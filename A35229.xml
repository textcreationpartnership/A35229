            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is a ſaying, That the greateſt Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to a Souldier or Traveller, is to diſcourſe of their former Dangers and Adventures; And if the relating of them be ſo pleaſant, certainly the hearing thereof is no leſs divertive. Now in this little Volume you may meet with variety of Accidents of all kinds, for here you may ſee on the one ſide <hi>Pompous Greatneſs</hi> laid as low as <hi>Contempt</hi> it ſelf, and on the other hand <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Obſcurity</hi> raiſed up to <hi>amazing</hi> and <hi>Prodigious Heights;</hi> Here you may find ſome ſuch noble Spirits, that they could not reſt ſatisfied, till by their own hazards they had diſcovered <hi>New Worlds,</hi> and brought one Hemiſphere to ſome Acquaintance with the other; Here you may obſerve, That though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> the Temple of Honour was ſo contrived, that therein was no Paſſage to it but through that other of <hi>Virtue,</hi> yet that things are far otherwiſe than they ought to be, and that Virtue is as familiarly perſecuted as rewarded, nor have Perſons of worth been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways barely beholden to their Merit for their Preferment, but perhaps ſome petty Accident, or inconſiderable Circumſtance hath been the occaſion of their Advancement. Here you may remark, That as ſome men who have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sentence of Condemnation in themſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:63178:3"/>
have had unlook'd for Deliverance, and have miraculouſly eſcaped when in all Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon they might be numbred among the Dead; So others have been the haſteners of their own Downfalls and Deſtruction, and have made their own Graves with their own Tongues, by their Temerity and raſhneſs in Talking; Here laſtly we may be ſeriouſly inform'd, that their is no Creature ſo ſmall and inconſiderable in our Eyes, but if the Almighty pleaſe may be able to afflict, yea and ruine us, when we are in the fulneſs of our ſufficiency; Theſe with a multitude of other Inſtances of various natures and kinds are the ſubject matter of this ſmall Treatiſe, which being duly contemplated are ſufficient proofs to a conſidering Mind of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour and Divine Power, that viſibly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf in the Occurrences and Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this lower World, and diſpoſes of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> as it pleaſeth, even beyond either their Hopes or Fears; and if the Peruſal of theſe Stupendious Examples produce ſuch a real Belief in the Reader, the Publiſher will think himſelf ſufficiently recompenced for his Labour and Pains; and may conclude with the Poet, That

            <p>THE Surprizing Adventures and Events that daily aſſail Mankind, are ſo Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and Extraordinary, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems more inſeparable to our Mortal ſtate, than conſtant and continual Viciſſitudes, Changes and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; But ſince we find in Hiſtory, that ſome more Remarkable Accidents have happened to ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Perſons than to others, it muſt needs be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delightful among ſuch a multitude of Inſtances, to give an Account of the moſt Conſiderable Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I have met with in many credible Writers, and that is the deſign of this ſmall Tract; wherein I ſhall not ſo much regard the Method, Order, or other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of an exact Hiſtorian, as in the whole to divert the Reader with what may be both pleaſant and profitable, wherein it may be he may more fully inform himſelf of ſeveral matters, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly heard of, but yet did not ſo cleerly underſtand; This without any further Preface is that which I now aim at, wherein I will impoſe nothing upon any mans belief, but leave every one at his full Liberty what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Faith he will exerciſe therein, it being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that I have cited my Authors, who are generally ſuch as have been accounted Men of Veracity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63178:4"/>
in the Accounts they give, and may therefore challenge as much Credit as is due to any Humane Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Strange were the Adventures of <hi>Chriſtopher Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> who diſcovered a <hi>New World</hi> in the laſt Age, which is now called <hi>America;</hi> He was born at <hi>Nervi</hi> in the Seigniory of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who being a man of excellent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; and born to undertake great matters, could not perſwade himſelf, but that, conſidering the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, there muſt needs be another World to which that Glorious Planet did impart both his Life, and Heat, when he went from us; This World he purpoſed to ſeek after, and in 1486 he diſcovered his Deſign to the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who rejecting his Propoſals, he ſent his Brother <hi>Bartholomew</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh of <hi>England,</hi> who in his Voyage hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unhappily fell into the hands of Pyrates, by whom he was long kept Priſoner, but having at laſt obtained his Liberty, he repaired to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> where he found ſuch cheerful entertainment at the hands of that King, that <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus</hi> was ſent for to come thither alſo; But <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Brothers Impriſonment, and not hearing from him, conceived the offer of his ſervice to have been neglected, and thereupon made his deſires known at the Court of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> where after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and ſix years attendance upon the buſineſs, he was at laſt furniſhed with three ſhips only, and thoſe not for Conqueſt but Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>With this ſmall ſtrength he ſailed on the Ocean ſixty dayes, and yet could ſee no land, ſo that the diſcontented <hi>Spaniards</hi> began to Mutiny, and refuſed to move a foot forward; Juſt at which time it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Columbus</hi> diſcerned the Clouds to carry a cleerer colour than they did before, and therefore intreated them to expect only three days longer, in which time, if they ſaw not land he promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; Toward the end of the third day, one of the Company deſcried Fire, which was an evident token
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63178:4"/>
that they drew near to ſome ſhore; The Place they diſcovered was an Iſland on the Coaſt of <hi>Florida</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Columbus</hi> St. <hi>Salvador;</hi> Having Landed his Men, he cauſed a Tree to be cut down, and made a Croſs thereof which he ſet up neer the place where he came on Land, and by that Ceremony took Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>New World</hi> for the Kings of <hi>Spain, Octob.</hi> 11. 1492. Afterwards he diſcovered and took Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and with much Treaſure and Content returned to <hi>Spain,</hi> and was preferred by the King for this good Service, firſt to be Admiral of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and in concluſion to the Title of the Duke <hi>De la Vega</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica;</hi> The next year he was furniſhed with 18 Ships for further Diſcovery; in this ſecond Voyage he diſcovered the Iſlands of <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and built the Town of <hi>Iſabella,</hi> after called <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> from whence for ſome ſeverities uſed againſt the mutinous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he was ſent Priſoner to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> but very honourably entertained, and cleared from all Crimes imputed to him.</p>
            <p>In 1497. he began his Third Voyage; in which he diſcovered the Countries of <hi>Paria</hi> and <hi>Cumana</hi> on the <hi>firm Land,</hi> with the Iſlands of <hi>Cubagna,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita,</hi> and many other Iſlands, Capes and Provinces; In 1500 he began his fourth and laſt Voyage, in the courſe whereof coming to <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> he was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily denied entrance into the City of <hi>Domingo,</hi> after which ſcowring the Sea-Coaſts, he returned back to <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſix years after he died, and was buried Honourably at <hi>Sevil,</hi> where to this day an Epitaph remaineth on his Tomb, far ſhort of his merit, which is to this purpoſe.</p>

out of the Channel, and though we met with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Guſts we reached <hi>Cape St. Vincent</hi> in 20 days, deſigning to unload ſome Goods at <hi>Cales;</hi> when we came near the <hi>Cape,</hi> we eſpied two Ships to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward making toward us, upon which we cleared our Decks, charged our Guns, and prepared all things for our defence, ſome imagined them to be <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they put out <hi>French</hi> Colours, but when they came within half a League of us they diſcovered themſelves to be <hi>Turks Men of War</hi> by their <hi>bloudy</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which they put out inſtead of the <hi>white;</hi> Then began our Captain to be amazed, our Company to be affrighted, and every one to beſtir himſelf; I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one Fellow who before had ſome diſeaſe in his Legs and Hands, much like the Gout, which made him hitherto uſeleſs, yet now in danger he skipped about, and handled the Guns as if nothing had ailed him. We had then aboard about an 100 men, with Paſſengers of ſeveral Nations, and 30 Great pieces of Ordnance, with other ſmall Guns.</p>
            <p>About ſeven afternoon, the <hi>Turks</hi> overtook us, and the foremoſt Veſſel gave us a Broadſide, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther followed, and ſaluted us in the ſame manner, and we returned them the like, the Fight was furious and Bloudy for four hours, our Men behaved themſelves gallantly, neither Death nor wounds could force them from their Charge nor Poſts, ſome when their Limbs were all bruiſed, their Bones ſhattered, and their Bodies all torn with Splinters, did obſtinately continue to manage the Guns, every one reſolved to dye with his weapons in his hands rather than to ſhrink in the leaſt from the Fight. In this four hours we received near 50 Broadſides, and our Enemies were as obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as we; Our number was at laſt reduc'd to eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men, moſt of them wounded ſo that we could no longer reſiſt the Numbers, and Fury of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who continued to pour in upon us great and ſmall Shot, and withal our Ship was ſhot through between Wind and Water, which cauſed us to make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63178:11"/>
but weak reſiſtance, and the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving it, were afraid the Sea would at laſt ſwallow us and deprive them of their Booty, and therefore reſolved to board us, grapling on both ſides of us, and their men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring, but we from our Fore-Caſtle and Steerage with our Murdering Pieces forced them back again, at laſt for fear our obſtinacy ſhould cauſe our Ship to ſink under us, and deliver us into the hands of a more mercileſs enemy the raging Sea, we called for Quarter, which the <hi>Turks</hi> willingly gave, almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of Succeſs; We found near 300 of our Men killed, my ſelf was ſhot through the Right Arm, and the Enemies ſhips were miſerably rent and torn; One thing during the Fight I judged an ill Omen, that at a broadſide, one great ſhot was forced back again, and ſplit in pieces, which we conceived had met with a more violent one that had driven it upon us; The <hi>Turks</hi> treated us more generouſly than we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from Enemies whom we had angred by ſo long reſiſtance, commending our Courage, and admiring our Reſolution and when they ſaw the rich Loading they had gained, they ſoon pardoned the injuries we had done them.</p>
            <p>The Captains of the <hi>Turks</hi> called to me and the Skipper for our <hi>Bills of Lading,</hi> which we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to deliver; I made ſome Reflections on my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Condition, and wiſhed my ſelf, as poor as <hi>Job</hi> upon a Chriſtian ſhore; Liberty was dear to me that was taken a ſlave, I remembred then that excellent advice, <hi>Truſt not in uncertain riches;</hi> I then condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Joy I had felt for the rich Patrimony that was left me, and the earneſt deſire to ſee Forreign Places, and ſorrowfully recalled to mind my former Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but all theſe Reflections and Regrets could not turn the Wind, nor ſtop our Courſe towards <hi>Argiers</hi> where we were next bound, for we Chriſtians who were left alive were diſpoſed into the Enemies Ships, and ſtript of our beſt attire, which ſome luſty Rogues did us the kindneſs to wear for our ſakes before our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63178:12"/>
Eyes; The dead bodies and thoſe paſt Recovery were ſtript naked and ſent to feed Sharks, and other ravenous Fiſhes of the Sea, which we ſaw at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant waiting as we thought, being it may be as ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of dead Bodies amongſt us, as Vultures, who in theſe Countries conſtantly hover about a Houſe or Tent, where ſick People who will there infallibly die, are, in hopes to enjoy the Prey, the dead bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to that purpoſe; we were uſed as civilly a Shipboard as we could expect from <hi>Turks,</hi> feeding with them on Garlick, Rusk, poor <hi>John,</hi> Rice and the like; I obſerved them very inquiſitive to examine us apart about our Qualities, and Friends, which we were forewarned of, and therefore I perſwaded all our Company to repreſent me as a poor Fellow, only intruſted by my Maſter, which ſatisfied them, till by diſcourſe with ſome <hi>Engliſh Renegadoes,</hi> one of them ſuſpected me; after which they ſet a higher value on me as expecting a greater ranſom; we ſailed into the <hi>Streights,</hi> and the next day Anchored in the Bay of <hi>Argiers;</hi> ſome Officers thereof coming to take notice of our number and the Price; One of them was a <hi>Corniſh</hi> man, who by his Apoſtacy had got great wealth being a Trader in ſlaves, well knowing how to make advantage by his own Nation; He inquired in what part of <hi>England</hi> we were born, but I deſired him as a Countryman to ſhew us ſome favour, and buy us for himſelf which he promiſed to do if we did give him hopes of returning our Money, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent as he ſaid our falling into ſeverer hands to the endangering of our lives, ſince if we came on ſhore we ſhould be led to the Market and ſold like Horſes, and might be bought by thoſe that would uſe us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanely, and exact from us the remainder of our Eſtates, but he being our Countryman would be our Friend, and take no more for us than it coſt him if we would freely diſcover our ſelves to him; we with our Eyes on each other diſcovered how inclinable we were to comply with him, though we were ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63178:12"/>
Jealous of this <hi>Turks</hi> Faith, judging that he who was not True to his God, would ſcarce be ſo to us, which we afterward found too true, for thoſe that were poor and had few friends were left to their ill Fortune, and the others the Owners ſet a high value on, ſo that we repeated our Credulity in this Wretch, but not agreeing on the Price we were ſet on ſhore.</p>
            <p>Great Companies came flocking to ſee us, upon report of our Courage, ſome whoſe Relations had been ſlain, gave us ſuch welcome as became the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Impertinency of Heathens, loading us with Curſes and Imprecations, and inſulting ſtrangely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, ſo that had we not been guarded, we had been torn in pieces; a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado was ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rage for the loſs of his Comrade of the ſame Nation, that he drew his Cymeter, and begged Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſacrifice one of us, promiſing to pay his Ranſom; which being denied, he then deſired only cut off one of our ears, it chanced he came near one of us, and with a blow ſtruck off a part of the Cheek of a <hi>German,</hi> which he greedily ſwallowed down, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that he never taſted ſo ſweet a Morſel in his days, ſo ſtrangely had Vengeance poſſeſt him, that he deſired to feed upon us. But our keepers ſafely conveyed us into the City, where we found our Chains ready made waiting for us; Every one of us had a ſtrong Chain about 20 pound weight linked to our Legs, and tied to our Girdles, that if we did medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate an eſcape, it ſhould not be without difficulty. In this ſtrange Equipage we were conducted with our gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Chains to the Kings Palace, much wondring what they intended to do with us in a place of ſo much hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. We paſt the firſt Guard, and came into a ſpacious Court paved with White Marble, whereof there is great quantity near old <hi>Carthage</hi> or <hi>Tunis</hi> in this Countrey, it was incloſed with a high brick Wall, wherein was a large Gate chequered with divers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which led us into a Great Hall, where we ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the King of <hi>Argiers</hi> came to viſit us, an honour
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63178:13"/>
we did not expect, but it ſeems 'tis the Cuſtom for him to view all the Slaves when they firſt land, out of whom he chuſes for himſelf the Tenth Perſon, and likewiſe one more whom he pleaſes; we were placed round about the Hall ready for his coming in, which was not ſpeedily, for being about Noon, he had been Bathing himſelf, and then taking another Recreation which is uſual at that time of day in theſe hot Climates. About two a Clock in comes a luſty Officer clothed in Scarlet, with a Rod in his hand and a great Turbant about his head, who was the Kings Gentleman-Uſher, followed by ſix Perſons of good Meen and Appearance, armed with Scymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Next came a Grave Fellow with a Turbant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as big as our <hi>Engliſh</hi> half Buſhel, at one ſide he had a ſet of Diamonds which did ſparkle like his Eyes, his Garment was green, his Legs were bare, and on his feet he wore Sandals; we had time to obſerve him as he entred the door, for his pace was ſlow and Grave, I could have numbred 20 between every ſtep; He marched in that manner to the upper end, where there was a Canopy of State over his Head, and two <hi>Turkey</hi> Carpets with a large Damask Pillow under him upon which he ſate; then the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Ships preſented themſelves before him, kiſſing the Hem of his Garment, they diſcourſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves about an hour, and then preſented the King (who only ſate, all the reſt ſtanding about him) with a Conſiderable Preſent in Cloth and other rich Commodities; The King then veiwed every one of us with a Stern Countenance, and took notice of our Features and Stature, for the <hi>Turks</hi> are excellent in Phyſiognomy, and know a mans Temper and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations at firſt view as well as an expert Farrier does the good and ill Qualities of a Horſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed concerns thoſe who Trade in Slaves; He caſt a Jeſt upon every one, which gave the Company a great deal of Mirth, but encreaſed our Sadneſs; He choſe out of the Company my ſelf, the Skipper,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63178:13"/>
and a pretty ruddy <hi>German</hi> Boy, which I wondred at, ſince he could expect no ranſom for him, but I after underſtood the good old man was a great Lover of his pleaſures, and therefore pitched on him to give him ſome in his old Age, a ſtrange fancy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Minds of all the <hi>Southern</hi> People, ſo that they burn with the Fire which conſumed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was glad to be in poſſeſſion of the King hoping to get my Freedom, who inquiring of my Quality, I told him I was a Cook, which he was glad of, as wanting one; but I proved a mad Cook, putting in ſometimes Oyl inſtead of Vinegar, and Salt inſtead of Pepper, yet I handled my meat ſo nimbly, that they all believed I had been uſed to Cookery; But I loſt my Place on this occaſion; at a Feaſt my Maſter made, I had ſeveral ſorts of Fiſhes that I never ſaw before, the Liver of one hath a moſt lothſome Taſte, I thought it good in the Sauce, and therefore I ſent it up ſtewed under the Fiſh, in a Diſh garniſhed with Flowers; The Gueſts ſeeing ſuch a pleaſant Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, expected the Fiſh to be extraordinary, and prepared their Stomachs to feed thereon, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting others much better, but taſting the Sauce they thought it a Sir reverence, and all began to ſpew and ſpit. I angered the King ſo much with this Maſter-peice of Cookery, that he ordered I ſhould recieve ten Baſtinado's for my Sallary, I vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Ignorance and our Countrey Faſhion, being forced to endure it with patience; For this, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likewiſe Jealous of me about one of his Women, who was indeed very kind to me, he was reſolved to part with me, and gave order I ſhould be led into the Market-place, and there Sold; When I ſaw my ſelf with an ill-favoured <hi>Turk,</hi> leading me with a Chain like a Horſe or Bullock through the Streets I began to lament my hard Fate, doubting what ſurly Maſter I ſhould have next; The <hi>Turk</hi> that led me, cried before me in <hi>Lingua Franca; Who will buy a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63178:14"/>
Chriſtian? Who will buy a Chriſtian?</hi> It was a grievous change of Fortune to be reduced in one year from my Fathers Honourable Eſtate to the loweſt miſery even that of a Slave, to be ſold as a Beaſt in a ſtrange Countrey where I had no Friends that durſt own me. Their manner of ſelling ſlaves is thus, They lead them up and down the Market, and when any bids Money, they cry, <hi>a Rache, a Rache,</hi> that is, <hi>Here's ſo much money bidden, who bids more?</hi> The buyers are very ſubtle, and firſt look into their mouths, and a ſtrong ſet of Grinders will much advance the price, arguing rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, That thoſe who have no Teeth cannot eat, and they that cannot eat cannot work, and therefore are not for their turn, nor their Money; For they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to keep them at hard meat all the year, and therefore it muſt not be Gums but ſolid, and if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible caſe hardned Teeth that muſt chew it, and an Oſtriches Stomach to digeſt it; next they feel their Limbs, whether any Fracture or Diſlocation, which will much lower the price; and therefore to be clean Limbed, cloſe Coupled, and well joynted, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it as much; The Age is alſo very conſiderable, but the Slaves not being obliged to diſcover it, and they not breeding them that ſell them, they judge by the Face, Hair or Beard, but a good ſet of Teeth will make one 10 years younger, and a bad ſet as much older; The ſeller commends his Goods to the sky; O ſays he, <hi>Mark what a Back he has, what a breadth between the Shoulders, what a Cheſt! how ſtrong ſet! how fitted on purpoſe for Burdens, He'l do but e'ne too much work;</hi> The Buyer on the other hand as much undervalues him, <hi>Piſh,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>he looks like a Pilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, a very Meacock at his Provender, and one that ſeems to be ſurfeited.</hi> But they are very curious in examining the Hands, for if they be hard and brawny, they will ſhrewdly gueſs they have been inured to Labour, if delicate and tender, they will ſuſpect him to be ſome Merchant, and then the hopes of a good price for Redemption makes him ſaleable; When any are ſold
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63178:14"/>
they muſt be brought back once more to the Kings Palace that he may view them again, and if he likes any at the prizes they went off at, there is no more diſpute, they are his own.</p>
            <p>When I was come into the Market-Place, a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low offers my Keeper money for me, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers came about me, and among the reſt that ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured <hi>Engliſhman</hi> aforementioned, I trembled for fear of falling into his hands, knowing how cruelly he had handled ſome of my Comrades; My keeper made advantage of the Croud, and asked an 100 Dollars more for me than he was ordered; The firſt who ſeemed by his looks to be a good Man, though of no great appearance would not let me ſlip out of his hands, but paid the Money, and led me to a Houſe next the <hi>Grand Moſque</hi> or Church of the City, neer the Kings Palace; My loving Lady having employed this Fellow to buy me for her Service, became very devout after my coming to that place, ſeldom miſſing a day without coming to her Devotions at the Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette, from whence there was a Paſſage into my Lodgings. By this frequent and conſtant attendance at Publick Prayer, ſhe purchaſed a great eſteem with the People, and a favour with her Husband, and ever after ſhe was counted a Saint, I continued her Slave about two years, imploying my ſelf in ſome Slaviſh work, but not above meaſure, ſo that I had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to view the City of <hi>Argiers,</hi> and took ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of many remarkable particulars.</p>
            <p>It is a City not ſo large as populous, Fortified by Art and Nature, the Walls are ſixty foot high, and in ſome places 70 or 80; Built with ſquare Stones or Flints about 12 foot broad; It is not above a Mile round: On the Eaſt-ſide, on the top of an high Hill ſtands a ſtrong Citadel, very well Fortified, built at firſt by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having 40 or 50 Pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Garriſoned by 300 Renegadoes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſtle ſomewhat leſs on the Weſt overlooks the Town; There is a very commodious <hi>Mold</hi> in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63178:15"/>
able to contain above 200 ſhips; upon which ſtands a ſtrong Fort threatning deſtruction to all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaillants Three Tyer of Guns being planted in it, the loweſt is level with the water; The <hi>Mold</hi> is ſo crooked that no ſhips can come in with full ſail without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that it is very difficult to break the Chain, and enter by force; This Neſt of Pyrates are very well prepared againſt the attempts of an enemy, none can hardly do them any injury either by Land or Sea, ſo that they retreat hither like wild Beaſts to their Dens, to enjoy their Thefts and Prey; The Town is built on a Rock hard to be undermined. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. attempted to drive them out of their neſts, but in vain, though he came with a Navy by Sea, and a puiſſant Army by Land to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege the Town; The violence of a Storm broke his veſſels to pieces, and forced him to raiſe the ſiege, with the loſs of an 100 ſhips, and many Thouſand men; ſince which <hi>Argiers</hi> is much ſtronger and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fortified daily, ſo that unleſs the <hi>European</hi> Princes join together, or ſome powerful Monarch lay ſiege to it by Sea and Land, it will be one day Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable unleſs by Famine. The Houſes of the City are very pleaſant, and more beautiful within and without than in other parts of <hi>Africa;</hi> the greater lye open in the middle with handſome Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and Turrets; ſeveral Moſquets are built for Publick Devotion, into which no Chriſtian muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unleſs he turn <hi>Turk,</hi> or elſe he will be burnt, or for handling the book of their Law before witneſs, or repeating their Prayer, <hi>Illa Alla Mahumet, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others have a great Number of their <hi>Talubs,</hi> or Religious men to read Publick Prayers, and others to expound the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Law; Over all is placed a <hi>Marabut,</hi> who is to Judge matters of Equity between Perſons; Beſides the King, and Baſhaw, the <hi>Lagaw,</hi> is the next chief man in this City, who is the firſt Perſon of the <hi>Divan</hi> or Council, and General of the Armies abroad, under whom are the <hi>Chenſes</hi> like our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63178:15"/>
Sheriffs or Juſtices of Peace; next are the <hi>Boulge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes,</hi> like our Bailiffs, who are Servants to the <hi>Divan,</hi> and remain 3 years in their places, going out after with the Armies as Comptrollers of the reſt. There are alſo other <hi>Buſhes,</hi> Captains and Officers of the <hi>Militia,</hi> who wear a badg of Honour on their heads, and are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt by their Turbant, which is wound about in the form of a Sugar-loaf, behind which a Redcroſs falls down, and is a badg of their Office, which others muſt not wear, as the Red-ſcarf is a ſign of Command among Chriſtians; In the Camp are other Great Officers as <hi>Daventees, Mouchees, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Achabaſha</hi> is an experienced man among them, who hath been in ſeveral Encounters, and commands a Party when it is ſeparated from the main Body; He muſt be an old Man, and when he once comes to that Employment he can riſe no higher as other Officers can. There are moſt pleaſant Gardens and Orchards about <hi>Argiers,</hi> and very good Corn upon the Hills near it, with plenty of all things but wine, which is forbidden to the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> yet thoſe of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</hi> have not ſuch ſcrupulous Conſciences, but that they will be drunk with wine when they take good ſtore of Prizes. Toward the Eaſt of the City is a very ſtrong Houſe built, and ſome ſouldiers to keep Guard, it being the Publick Treaſury Houſe wherein they every year caſt in vaſt ſums of Money accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſucceſs againſt the Chriſtians, which they never take out, ſo that its thought there are many Millions in that Hold; When the ſhips come in, there is alwayes ſomething for the Treaſury, and a good Portion for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and thoſe that read Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which is put into the hands of a Treaſurer, whom if they find to have converted the leaſt part thereof to his private uſe, he is cruelly put to death in this manner; He is ſtript naked, and at the door of the <hi>Marabut,</hi> he is impaled alive, that is a ſtake is thruſt into his Fundament and driven leaſurely up through his body; In this manner he is raiſed to the top of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63178:16"/>
the ſteeple of a <hi>Moſquet</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> where he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Publick view for three dayes, and then his body is carried out of the City to be given for food to the wild beaſts, and his Eſtate ſold for the benefit of the Religious men; There are excellent Orders to ſtir them up to their Worſhip, they are often called to Prayers that is in the Morning, at twelve a Clock, at four afternoon, at Sunſetting, at Twilight, and at Midnight, at all which times great numbers of all ſorts re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

entertainment but found worſe, he was cruel &amp; ſevere to me, making me work night and day; I often treated for my ranſom, but his demands were ſo high, that I could not comply with him; He abuſed we wretchedly about five Months, and then death put an end to his Tyranny; His Executors ſold me again among his Goods and Chattels; I fell next into the hands of an <hi>Italian</hi> Renegado, who was no kinder to me than my former Maſters, my work was painful, my Diet mean, my Labour continual, and my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the blows of a hard Cudgel; I could not long endure this Service, and therefore ſought to diſpleaſe my Patron, and make him ſell me to another; He gave me next to an Officer of the <hi>Militia,</hi> who was ſo well pleaſed with my Perſon and Countenance that he reſolved not to part with me for any Money I offered him 800 Dollars, he told me, <hi>I ſhould firſt go with him into the Countrey, and at his return I ſhould have Liberty to be redeemed if I behaved my ſelf well;</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> about this time ſent a ſtrong Army to gather the Contributions, of the People, and to relieve <hi>Tremiſen</hi> or <hi>Climſan,</hi> a ſtrong Populous City in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> which commands all the reſt of Countrey, and was now beſieged by the <hi>Arabs</hi> their deadly Enemies;</p>
            <p>Having run through ſo many ſtrange and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Fortunes and Adventures, I doubted not but to meet with as much variety in this Expedition, my Maſter was Commander of an 100 men, he was very paſſionate and Laſcivious, but withal valiant; Our Army was compoſed of a thouſand Horſe, and two thouſand Foot, beſides Slaves and Servants; with which ſtrong Party we ſet forward, and found the Countrey very fruitful of Corn and Fodder; As we paſt by a Wood, we had the ſight of ſeveral wild Beaſts that returned from ſeeking their Prey; Our Vanguard ſhot at many of them, one of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſhew his Valour, met a Lyon that advanced toward us, and with his Scymiter in his hand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred

him, but the ſport almoſt coſt the Fellow his Life, for the Lyon was very ſtrong, and ſtruck him down twice with his Paws, and the laſt time in a rage bit off part of his Arm, and would have inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoured him, had we not all ſhot at him and fixed above an hundred Bullets in his Body; We found the Fellow almoſt dead with fear under the Lion; He was glad with the loſs of ſome of his Fleſh to have ſo happily eſcaped, none pitying him ſince his raſhneſs deſerved it. In three Leagues we came to a little Valley fruitful of Palms and Olivetrees, with a ſmall Rivulet covered with Strawberry Buſhes, and a Grove at the end; Wherein I ſaw a flying Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent about the bigneſs of an ordinary Dog, with a large mouth and Tongue about four foot long, we ſhot at it but could not kill it; It threatned ſome of our men, who ventured to go near it, and would not go till a great number came toward it; I ſaw it near a pleaſant Fountain, but could not learn the name; It had Wings of divers colours, eſpecially Red and White, bigger than thoſe of our winged Fowls, but I could not diſcern the ſubſtance of them; It hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long over our heads, and had not the noiſe of our Guns frighted it away, I think it had ventured among us again, all the Birds that ſaw it at a diſtance fled away. I imagined it to be a kind of Baſilisk; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Serpent, and extraordinary venemous, it was admired by all of us having never ſeen the like, which made me believe it ſome Inland Creature not uſually ſeen near the Sea-Coaſts.</p>
            <p>Our buſineſs in this Journey was to gather Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the Inhabitants, who do not willingly pay, and therefore the <hi>Turks</hi> are forced to go in great numbers to oblige them to it; The third day we paſſed over high Mountains fenced on all ſides with craggy Rocks, ſo that we were forced to climb over them. Our Horſe took a Compaſs about by a way more eaſie; About noon the Sun was extraordinary hot which cauſed us to ſeek a repoſe under the ſhady
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63178:18"/>
Trees that grew in this ſtony ground, as I was reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf between ſleep and waking, a great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Scorpion fixed her ſting in my naked Leg, ſo gently that I had not felt it, had I not been told thereof. I had heard much of this Serpent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtung began to fear the increaſe of the Venom, but ſome had already killed it, and brought the bloud to me to apply to the Wound, which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gave preſent Cure, for it had no ſooner touched the Tumor but it began to decreaſe, and out of the little wound came forth a Liquor white as Milk, by which I found the bloud of the Scorpion hath an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive Virtue; I had no ſooner eſcaped this Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but I fell into a worſe, My Maſter had ſent me to the Rear of the Army to buy Victuals for himſelf it being there ſold ready dreſt; As I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning loaded, I fell down a ſteep Rock with my Burden, but for fear my Maſter ſhould Cudgel me, I ſoon recovered my ſelf. From this unhappy place we removed up a Hill into a Countrey uninhabited, but by Monſters and wild Beaſts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſaw a great many; This Mountain is part of the <hi>Atlas</hi> and runs through all this Kingdom and <hi>Fez</hi> as far as the Main Ocean, part thereof being in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Region of the Air, and ſo cold that in ſome Corners which are not expoſed to the Sun, there was a great deal of Ice and Snow; Here we found plenty of Woods and Trees, and ſeveral ſorts of Birds, we killed one that had 4 Legs like a Beaſt; Its body was as big as a Turky-cock, and the head like an Owl, its Tail was extream broad, the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Gray, and the head black, it flies ſlowly, and was therefore killed without difficulty.</p>
            <p>Toward Evening we ſaw ſeveral ſorts of Lyons go out of their Dens, when the Jackals began to bark, the Nobleſt is called the <hi>Royal</hi> Lyon, of ſhape bigger and ſtronger, and a more couragious Voice; when any of the reſt meet ſuch a one, they ſeem to yeild a reſpect to him, He is graver in his motion, fiercer

in the Encounter, and undaunted in the greateſt danger, others are ſmaller; every night we were viſited with ſeveral Companies of wild Creatures, ſome of whom had the boldneſs to break in upon us, but never returned back to tell news. One Evening we diſcovered a great Beaſt afar off, and ſome of us went nearer to diſcharge our Guns at it; It was a Monſter of a large ſize, the head like a Lion, the Paws like a Bear, the hinder parts much like an Aſs. When it was killed every one in the Army had a ſight thereof, and I then remembred the ſaying of the <hi>Romans, Africa alwayes produces ſomething new,</hi> for there is every year ſome ſtrange Creature or other to be ſeen in thoſe remote places; ſome make it their buſineſs to watch them when they come into the World, and imploy all their Art to catch them, and ſhew them for money; In this wild place were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſorts of Beaſts and Serpents, one of a ſtrange nature ſeeming like a white Lamb, which fled before us; Our Captain thought it to be ſo, and that it had ſtraggled, and therefore we had order to perſue it, and coming near, it made more haſt than ordinary to ſhift among the Trees, but being very weary and over-fat, it could not eſcape us, yet ran into one of the Buſhes, where to prevent diſcovery its white colour was changed in an inſtant into that of the Buſh, which alteration gave us much trouble, and we had never found it again if one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had not diſcharged a Musket, at the noiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it roſe affrighted, and run for its life, we did not think it the ſame, yet ſome ventured after it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſtay'd in the place ſeeking the white beaſt. The Perſuers ſhot off one of its Legs, and then cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us to forbear ſeeking, and that the Counterfeit Lamb was caught. It was the ſame ſhaped Beaſt, but the colour was no more white as before, but chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a blackiſh Gray; Its Coat was a Fine Wool the head like a Wolf, but not quite ſo long, with very ſharp Teeth, and a fierce look, the hinder
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63178:19"/>
parts like a ſheep, we wondred at this change of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and imagined it to be that Beaſt mentioned by by the Learned, and is a good Emblem of a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
            <p>Having in three days got over theſe Mountains and lying down to refreſh our ſelves, in the Morning an Alarum was ſounded, at which we all ran to our Arms, and put our ſelves in Order, expecting the coming of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> but no Enemy appeared, only a Company of Apes perſued by a few Jackalls who made ſuch a noiſe in running about the branches of the Wood near us, yet thoſe upon the skirts of the Army thought them to be the Enemy, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the advantage of the place to fall upon us; their needleſs fear did as ſoon appear as the nimble Creatures recovered the tops of the higheſt Trees, to whoſe protection they durſt commit themſelves; yet the Alarum continued, and ran as nimbly as the Apes all over the Army, which could not be ſtopt till every one was informed of the true cauſe of the Fright.</p>

            <p>After we had taken all the Country which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, we returned to the Maritime City of <hi>Argiers,</hi> My Maſter was grown very rich, and powerful, and had got great honour, and great wealth for his Services.

            <p n="8">VIII. The Adventures, Dangers and Troubles of <hi>Katherine</hi> Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Suffolk</hi> are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, as we find them recorded in the Book of Martyrs. This Dutcheſs was the Widow of <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and after his death was married to <hi>Richard Berty</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>. In the firſt year of Queen <hi>Mary, Stephen Gardiner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> knowing this Dutcheſs to be a zealous Proteſtant, and no good Friend of his, reſolved to be revenged of her husband firſt, and <hi>ſubpoena'd</hi> him before him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, <hi>That it was the Queens pleaſure he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pay</hi> 4000 <hi>pound due to her Father from D.</hi> Charles <hi>late husband to his Dutcheſs,</hi> whoſe Executrix ſhe was. Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> replyed, <hi>That Debt was already truly ſatisfied.</hi> The Biſhop anſwered, <hi>The Queen would not be put off with payments in the time of</hi> Kets <hi>Government,</hi> (ſo he in ſcorn called King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth's Reign;) Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was acknowledged to be paid by K.</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth. If that be true,</hi> ſaid the Biſhop; <hi>I will ſhew you favour, but Mr.</hi> Berty, ſays he, <hi>I muſt tell you another thing becauſe I intend you well; I hear ill of your Religion, and pray is your Lady now as forward to ſet up Maſs as ſhe was to pull it down, when ſhe cauſed a Dog in a Rochet to be carried with her, which ſhe called by my name, or doth ſhe now think her Lambs as ſafe, as when ſhe ſaw me vail my Bonnet to her out of the Tower window, at which time ſhe ſaid,</hi> 
               <q>That it was merry with the Lambs when the Wolves were ſhut up.</q> 
               <hi>And at another time when my Lord her husband invited me amongſt other Lords to Dinner, deſiring every Lady to chuſe him whom ſhe liked beſt, and ſo place themſelves together, your Lady taking me by the hand ſaid,</hi> 
               <q>That ſince ſhe might

not ſit by her husband whom ſhe loved beſt, ſhe had choſen me whom ſhe loved worſt.</q> To which Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> replyed; <hi>My Lord, Of the device of the Dog, ſhe was neither the Author nor Allower. As for her words ſhe can anſwer her ſelf, and for the Maſs ſhe hath been taught by learned men to abhorre it, and therefore if ſhe ſhould outwardly pretend to it, ſhe would be a falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to Chriſt, and a maſquing Subject to her Prince, you know my Lord, one Judgment reformed is better than a Thouſand Transformed Time-ſervers. Yea marry,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>deliberation is good, if ſhe were to come from an old Religion to a New, but ſhe is to return from a new one to an old one; when I was her Ghoſtly Father ſhe was as earneſt a Papiſt as any My Lord,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Berty, ſhe told a Friend lately,</hi> 
               <q>That Religion went not by Age, but by Truth, and therefore ſhe was to be converted by Argument and not by Compulſion.</q> 
               <hi>Pray do you think it poſſible,</hi> ſays the Biſhop, <hi>to perſwade her? I hope,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Berty, you will find no fruits of Infidelity in her.</hi> The Biſhop then perſwaded Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> to take pains in her Converſion, promiſing him large Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to effect it, and ſo diſmiſt him.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> came home he had frequent inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations from his Friends, That the Biſhop intended to call his Dutcheſs to an Account for her Faith, and therefore they deſigned to go beyond Sea. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance whereof Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> made ſuch Friends to the Queen, as to obtain her Licenſe to paſs and repaſs at pleaſure, to receive ſeveral ſummes of money due to Duke <hi>Charles</hi> from the Emperor of <hi>Germany;</hi> Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> went beyond Sea accordingly, but without his Dutcheſs who yet by agreement was to follow, and made her eſcape from this deſperate danger in the manner following.</p>
            <p>She dwelt at that time in <hi>Barbiean,</hi> and acquainted none of her Servants with her deſign but only one old Gentleman, neither did ſhe take any but the meaneſt of her Servants with her, fearing the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would not run ſo dangerous an adventure, ſhe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63178:22"/>
took alſo her young Daughter of a year old with her. Upon New-years-day, about four a Clock in the Morning ſhe went from her own houſe, and an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald of the Queens who lay in her houſe to guard her hearing the noiſe, roſe up, and came down with a lighted Torch in his hand, ſo that for fear of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſhe was forc't to leave moſt of her Childs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries behind, and ordered her Servants to make haſt to <hi>Lyon Key,</hi> taking with her only two Women and her Child; ſhe was no ſooner out of doors but the Herald followed, whereupon ſhe ſtepped into the <hi>Charterhouſe</hi> Gate, ſo that he could not ſee her, the Herald finding ſome things ſhe had loſt, fell to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacking them, and in the mean time ſhe haſted away knowing the place only by name, where ſhe ſhould take boat. Her Servants alſo divided themſelves, and only one of them knew the way thither; Thus ſhe attired in a mean habit, and they that were with her, took their way into <hi>Finsbury</hi> Fields, where by the ſpecial Providence of Heaven, near <hi>Moregate</hi> ſhe and all her Company met, and went together to <hi>Lyon-Key,</hi> a Barge was there ready for her; but the morning was ſo extream miſty that the Steerſman would not venture out without great intreaty. Soon after the Council were informed of her departure, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome came preſently to her houſe to inquire out the manner of her eſcape, and to take an Inventory of her Goods, and Orders were iſſued to apprehend her, ſo that the noiſe of her Flight, was at <hi>Leigh</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> before her Arrival.</p>
            <p>When ſhe came thither, the old Gentleman her Servant carried her privately to a Merchants houſe near <hi>Leigh,</hi> naming her Miſtriſs <hi>White,</hi> where ſhe ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till ſhe had made ſome new Proviſion for her Child in the room of that left behind her at <hi>Barbican.</hi> When the time came ſhe was to take Shipping, ſhe hardly eſcaped Diſcovery, and being 'twice carried into the Seas almoſt within ſight of <hi>Zealand,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds was driven back to the place whence
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63178:22"/>
ſhe came; And at her laſt return the ſearchers ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſhe might be in that Ship, examined her Servant that came to buy Victuals, who told them ſuch an innocent Story of a Merchants Wife which was on Shipboard, that they ſearcht no further; and ſo at laſt the ſafely arrived in <hi>Brabant,</hi> where ſhe met with her Husband, who apparelling her and her Women like <hi>Dutch</hi> Froes, they travelled to <hi>Santon,</hi> and had leave from the Magiſtrates to live privately there, but it being reported they were greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages than they pretended, the Biſhop and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates reſolved to ſeize and examine them both of their Condition and Religion; but Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> having ſecret notice thereof, took his Dutcheſs, his Child, and the two Women, and about three Afternoon in <hi>February</hi> walked out as if to take the Air, intending that Night to get to <hi>Weſel,</hi> and the better to conceal his deſign they went on Foot, and left the reſt of their Family at <hi>Santon:</hi> They had not gone above an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile, but there fell a mighty Rain, which diſſolved the Froſt and Ice; and ſo made the wayes deep and ſlippery, which proved extream tedious to theſe new Lacquies, and no Waggon to be gotten, ſo that Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> was forced to carry the Child, and the Dutcheſs his Cloak and Rapier, the Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent before. At laſt, near ſeven a Clock in the dark Evening, they came to <hi>Weſel,</hi> ſeeking after ſuch a tedious Journey to repoſe and refreſh their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Limbs in an Inn, but they all refuſed to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, though they offered a conſiderable ſum for the ſame, judging them to be ill People.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the poor Babe cried bitterly, the Dutcheſs wept as faſt, the Weather was extream Cold, and the Heavens rained as faſt as the Clouds could pour. Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> deſtitute of all Worldly Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relief for him and his, in this deplorable Condition, reſolved to carry the Dutcheſs with her Infant into the Porch of the great Church, and ſo to buy ſome Coals, Food and Straw for their Repoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63178:23"/>
that night, or at leaſt till he could procure ſome better Lodging; Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> could ſpeak little <hi>Dutch,</hi> and could meet with none who underſtood either <hi>Engliſh, French, Italian,</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> till going toward the Church he heard two Boys ſpeaking in <hi>Latin,</hi> who ſtepping to them, promiſed them two Stivers if they would bring him to a <hi>Walloons</hi> houſe, and ſo it pleaſed God he happened into a houſe where Mounſieur <hi>Rivers</hi> a Miniſter was at Supper, he had formerly been in <hi>England,</hi> and received ſome Courteſies from this good Dutcheſs; Mounſieur <hi>Rivers</hi> going to the door, and ſeeing Mr. <hi>Berty,</hi> his Dutcheſs and Infant in that lamentable Caſe with Rain, Mire and Dirt, and in Apparel ſo unlike what he had ſeen them in <hi>England,</hi> was ſo overwhelmed with ſorrow, and tears, that for ſome time he could neither ſpeak to them, nor they to him: At laſt they ſaluted each other, and he brought them to his houſe, into which God knows they entred joyfully, Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> changing his Clothes with the good Man of the Houſe, the Dutcheſs with his Wife, and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant with the Child of the Houſe. Here they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time, and then hired a Houſe, where they diſcovered themſelves freely, and lived in good faſhion, but whilſt they paſt the time here with ſome content, in hope of reſting after their Tedious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Sir <hi>John Maſon,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Ambaſſador in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> gave them private notice of a deſign for ſeizing and carrying them back to <hi>England,</hi> managed by the L. <hi>Paget.</hi> For the D. of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> being to paſs by that City with ten Companies of Souldiers to aſſiſt the Emperour againſt the <hi>French,</hi> it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived that he ſhould ſuddenly apprehend them, and carry them away from <hi>Weſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Information Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> with his Dutcheſs, &amp; Child, preſently fly into the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and found Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in <hi>Wincheim,</hi> but the money which they brought out of <hi>England</hi> being almoſt ſpent, they began to faint under their heavy burden, being almoſt out of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63178:23"/>
heart and hope in this their diſtreſſed condition, at which time it pleaſed God to provide wonderfully for them by the following means. One <hi>John a Laſco,</hi> being driven out of <hi>England</hi> at Queen <hi>Maries</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Crown, after many troubles and adventures returned into <hi>Poland</hi> his Native Countrey, where he found great favour with that King, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Condition of Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> and his Dutcheſs whom he had known in <hi>England,</hi> he gave an account thereof to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Vilna,</hi> who preſently wrote to them to come thither with great offers of kindneſs. They returned Letters full of Thanks to the King, and <hi>Palatine,</hi> and ſent with them all the remainder of the Jewels which they had brought from <hi>England;</hi> and having received Letters of Conduct for their Security, in <hi>April</hi> 1557 the Dutcheſs with her Husband and Family began their Journey toward <hi>Poland.</hi> By the way they met with many dangers; One was occaſioned by a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lantgraves who quarrelled with Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> about a Spaniel of his, and with his Horſemen ſet upon them by the way, thruſting their Boar-ſpears through the ſides of the Waggon where the Children and Women were, yet it pleaſed God none of them were hurt; Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> had only four Horſemen with him, and in the quarrel the Captains Horſe was ſlain under him, upon which a Rumor was preſently ſpread about the Countrey, that the <hi>Lantgraves</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was ſlain by the <hi>Walloons,</hi> which much enraged the Common people againſt them. The Dutcheſs underſtanding their danger, perſwaded her husband to leave them, and by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe to recover ſome Town for his Security; which Mr. <hi>Berty</hi> attempting to do, was eagerly purſued by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and the Captains Brother, who thought he had been ſlain indeed. And in the purſuit they came ſo near him that he had certainly been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but that as God would have it, ſpying a Ladder ſtanding againſt a Window, he leapt off his

            <p>After the death of <hi>Cyrus, Cambyſes</hi> his Son reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and King <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſtill remained in that Court. Now it happened that King <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had ſlain twelve <hi>Perſians</hi> of Principal rank, whom K. <hi>Croeſus</hi> thus admoniſhed, <hi>Do not O King,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>indulge thine Anger and Rage in every thing, but refrain your ſelf; It will be for your advantage to be prudent and provident, and foreſight is the part of a wiſe man, but you upon ſlight occaſions put to death your Countreymen, and ſpare not ſo much as young Children, If you ſhall go on to do often in this manner, conſider if you will not give occaſion to the</hi> Perſians <hi>to revolt from you; your Father</hi> Cyrus <hi>laid his ſtrict Commands upon me that as often as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould require I ſhould put you in mind of thoſe things which might conduce to your profit and welfare.

            <p>This <hi>Cambyſes</hi> was a very bloudy Tyrant which might be partly occaſioned by his Flatterers, for having a mind to marry his Siſter, he was told by his Lawyers, <hi>That they knew no Law which admitted ſuch Marriages, but that there was a Law that the</hi> Perſian <hi>Kings might do what they liſted;</hi> which Maxim he often put in Practice; For on a time deſiring to

The Watchword or ſignal was, That upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> day, when the Bell ſhould begin to toll to Evening prayers, all the <hi>Sicilians</hi> ſhould preſently run to Arms, and joyning together with one accord, ſhould fall upon all the <hi>French</hi> throughout <hi>Sicily;</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly all the Inhabitants of the Iſle were joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the appointed hour, and armed, ran upon the <hi>French,</hi> cut all their throats without taking ſo much as one Priſoner, or ſparing the Children, or Women who were got with Child by the <hi>French,</hi> that they might utterly extinguiſh the whole race of them; There were ſlain eight Thouſand at that time, and there eſcaped but a very ſmall number who fled into a Fort called <hi>Sperling,</hi> where for want of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals they were all ſtarved to death; And <hi>Don Pedro</hi> having according to Agreement rigged out his Navy under pretence of ſome exploit againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> came to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> there to expect how the Tragedy would be Acted, which falling out agreeably to his expectation, and coming in with his Navy juſt as the deed was done, he was by the General Conſent of all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Crowned King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the Government thereof remains under the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to this day; This bloudy Maſſacre is called <hi>The Sicilian Vespers</hi> or <hi>Even Song</hi> to this day. <hi>Heylin's Coſmog.

Curioſity. In the Land of <hi>Tranſiane</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> there was a Prince Tributary to the King of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and his near Kinſman named <hi>Alfonge,</hi> who married a Siſter of the Prince of <hi>Tazatai</hi> called <hi>Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lara,</hi> who was one of the greateſt Beauties in all thoſe Countreys. They lived a ſweet and happy life with intire Affection, and for their greater Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, they had two Twin Sons, who in their young Age diſcovered ſomething of great and lofty Minds; and appeared ſingularly hopeful for the future, Theſe Infants being now Ten years old, loved ſo cordially, that they could not live aſunder, and the deſires of the one ſtill met with the conſent of the other in all things; But the Devil the Enemy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord inſpires a Curioſity into the minds of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother to know their Fates, or Fortunes; and to their greif they were told, <hi>The time ſhould come when theſe two Brothers that now loved ſo fondly ſhould cut one anothers Throats;</hi> Which much aſtoniſhed the poor Princes, and filled them with fearful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions; The two Princes being come to their 15 years, one ſaid to the other; <hi>Brother it muſt needs be that you muſt murther me, for I will ſooner dye an hundred deaths than do you the leaſt hurt imaginable.</hi> The other replied, <hi>Believe it not good Brother, I beſeech you, for you are as dear or dearer to me than my ſelf.</hi> But the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent the misfortune reſolved to ſeparate them, whereupon they grew ſo troubled and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, that he was conſtrained to delay his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign till an occaſion happened which invited all three, the Father and his two Sons to a War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings of <hi>Narſinga</hi> and <hi>Pegu,</hi> upon Title of Territories. But by the Mediation of ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a Peace was concluded upon Condition that theſe two young Princes ſhould marry the two Daughters of the King of <hi>Narſinga,</hi> and that the King of <hi>Pegu</hi> ſhould confer on him that married the elder all the Countreys he took in the laſt War,

He from <hi>Verma</hi> came ſecretly to Town with one Servant only to viſit a Lady who had been once their Ancient Miſtris, and the other Brother being upon the ſame deſign, they met at the Ladies Gate by Night, not knowing one another, where fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with Jealouſie, after ſome words they drew and killed each other; One of them dying gave humble thanks to Heaven for preventing the direful deſtiny foretold him, that he ſhould kill his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; hereupon the other knowing by his Voice and Diſcourſe, drawing near his end, himſelf crept to him and embraced him with Tears and Lamentations and ſo both dolefully ended their days together. The Father having tydings of it, and ſeeing his white hairs led by his own fault to ſo hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, overborn with Grief and deſpair, came and ſlew himſelf upon the Bodies of his Sons, and with the greif and Tears of all the People were buried all three in one Monument, which ſhews us the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of too much Curioſity. <hi>Le Blanc's Travels.</hi> Tom. 1.</p>
            <p n="20">XX.

And gave ſpecial command that no diſtreſſed Perſon ſhould come into his Company, nothing ſad,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63178:34"/>
nothing Lamentable, nothing unfortunate, no poor man, no old man, none weeping nor diſconſolate was to come near his Pallace; Youthfulneſs, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Joy were alwayes in his Preſence, nothing elſe was to be ſeen, nothing elſe diſcourſed of in his Company. But alaſs in proceſs of time the Prince longed, this made him ſad in the very midſt of his Joyes, and what ſhould he long for, but not to be ſo cumbered with Delights; The grief of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures made him requeſt his Father to looſe the Bonds of his miſerable Felicity; This deſire of the Son croſſed the Intention of his Father, who was forced to give over his device to keep him from ſadneſs, leaſt by continuing it he ſhould make him ſad; He therefore gave him his Liberty, but charged his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to remove out of his way all objects of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; the blind, the maimed, the deformed and the old muſt not come near him. But what diligence is ſufficient to conceal the Miſeries of Mortality! The Prince in his Recreations meets with an old Man, Blind and Leprous; The ſight aſtoniſhes him, he ſtartles, trembles, and faints, like thoſe that ſwound at the Apparition of a Spirit, and inquires of his Followers what that thing might be. And being told that it was Man, he was ſo extreamly concerned thereat, that he diſliked Pleaſures, condemned Mirth, and deſpiſed Life, he rejected the Kingdom and Royal Dignity, and bid adieu to all the Blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fortune at once, ſpending the remainder of his days in a Religious Retirement from the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the World, and in preparations for Eternity. <hi>Vaughan Florilegus, pag.</hi> 126.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. The Ingenious Dr. <hi>R.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63178:34"/>
for ſurveying the Mannour Houſe, Park, Deer, Woods and other the Demeaſnes belonging to <hi>Woodſtock Mannor</hi> in that County, came thither, and ſat and lodged therein, they took up their Lodgings in the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and <hi>withdrawing Room</hi> thereof, the former whereof they alſo made their <hi>Kitchen,</hi> The <hi>Council Hall</hi> their <hi>Brewhouſe,</hi> The <hi>Chamber of Preſence</hi> they ſate in to diſpatch buſineſs, and made a <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> of the <hi>Dining-room; October</hi> 14 and 15 they had little diſturbance, but on the 16 there came as they thought ſomewhat into the <hi>Bedchamber</hi> where two of the Commiſſioners and their Servants lay, in the ſhape of a Dog, which going under their Beds did as it were gnaw their Bed-cords, but on the morning finding them whole, and a quarter of Beef which lay on the ground untouched; they began to entertain other thoughts. <hi>Octob.</hi> 17. Something to their thinking removed all the Wood out of the <hi>Dining-room</hi> into the <hi>Preſence-Chamber,</hi> and hurled the Chairs and Stools up and down that room; From thence it came into the two Chambers where the Commiſſioners and their Servants lay, and hoiſted up their Beds feet ſo much higher than their heads that they thought they ſhould have been turned over and over, and then let them fall down with ſuch a force that their bodies rebounded from the bed a good diſtance, and then ſhook the Bedſteads ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently that themſelves confeſt their Bodies were ſore with it. <hi>October</hi> 18 ſomething came into the <hi>Bed-chamber</hi> and walkt up and down, and fetching the Warming Pan out of the <hi>withdrawing Room</hi> made ſo much noiſe that they thought five Bells could not have made more; And <hi>Octob.</hi> 19. Trenchers were thrown up and down the Dining Room, and at them that lodged there, whereof one of them being ſhaken by the Shoulder and awakened, put forth his head to ſee what was the matter, but had Trenchers thrown at it; <hi>October</hi> 20. The Curtains of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63178:35"/>
the Bed in the <hi>withdrawing Room</hi> were drawn to and fro, and the Bed-ſtead much ſhaken, and eight great Pewter Diſhes, and three dozen of Trenchers thrown about the <hi>Bedchamber</hi> again, whereof ſome fell upon the beds; this night they alſo thought whole Armfulls of Wood had been thrown down in their Chambers, but in the morning they found nothing moved.</p>
            <p>On the 21 of <hi>October</hi> the keeper of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and his Bitch lay in one of the Rooms with them, which night they were not diſturbed at all; But <hi>October</hi> 2. though the Bitch kenelled there again to whom they aſcribed their former nights reſt, both they and the Bitch were in a pitiful taking, the Bitch opening but once, and that with a whining fearful yelp. <hi>October</hi> 23. They had all their Cloths pluck'd off them in the <hi>withdrawing Room,</hi> and the Bricks fell out of the Chimney into the Room, and the 24th. day they thought all the Wood had been brought thither, and thrown down cloſe by their Bedſide, which noiſe being heard by thoſe of the <hi>withdrawing Room;</hi> one of them roſe to ſee what was done, fearing indeed that his Fellow Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners had been killed, but found no ſuch matter; whereupon returning to his bed again, he found two Dozen of Trenchers thrown into it, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely covered with the Bed-clothes. <hi>October</hi> 25, The Curtains of the Bed in the <hi>withdrawing Room</hi> were drawn to and fro, and the Bed-ſtead ſhaken as before, and in the <hi>Bed-chamber,</hi> glaſs flew about ſo thick, that they thought it had been Money, (and yet not a pane of the Chamber Windows broken) but lighting a Candle, to their grief they found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Glaſs, which they took up in the Morning and laid together. <hi>October</hi> 29, ſomething walked in the <hi>withdrawing Room</hi> about an hour, and going to the Window opened and ſhut it, then going into the <hi>Bed-chamber,</hi> it threw great Stones for about half an
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63178:35"/>
hours time, ſome whereof lighted on the High-bed, and others on the Truckle-bed, to the number in all of about Fourſcore; This night there was alſo a very great noiſe as though 40 pieces of Ordnance had been ſhot off together; at two ſeveral knocks it aſtoniſhed all the Neighbouring Dwellers, which its thought might have been heard a great way off; During theſe noiſes which were heard in both Rooms together, both Commiſſioners and Servants were ſtruck with ſo great horror, that they cryed out to one another for help, whereof one of them recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf out of a ſtrange Agony he had been in, ſnatched up a Sword, and had like to have killed one of his Fellows, coming out of his bed in his ſhirt, whom took for the Spirit who did the miſchief; However at length they got all together, yet the noiſe contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo great and Terrible, and ſhook the Walls ſo much, that they thought the whole Houſe would have fallen on their Heads. At its departure it took all the Glaſs away with it.</p>
            <p>The 1. of <hi>November,</hi> ſomething as they thought walked up and down the <hi>withdrawing Room,</hi> and then made a noiſe in the <hi>Dining-room;</hi> The Stones that were left before and laid up in the <hi>withdrawing room</hi> were all fetched away this night, and a great deal of Glaſs, not like the former thrown about again. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 2. came ſomething into the <hi>withdrawing Room,</hi> treading as they conceived much like a Bear, which firſt only walking about a quarter of an hour, at length it made a noiſe about the Table, and threw the Warming-Pan ſo violently, that it quite ſpoiled it; It threw alſo glaſs and great Stones at them again, and the bones of Horſes, and all ſo violently that the bed-ſtead and walls were bruiſed by them. This night they ſet Candles all about the Rooms, and made Fires up to the Mantle Trees of the Chimneys; but all were put out, no body knew how, the Fire and Billets that made it being thrown up and down the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63178:36"/>
Rooms; the Curtains torn with the Rods from their Beds, and the Bed-poſts pulled away, that the Teſter fell down upon them, and the feet of the Bedſted was cloven in two; And upon the Servants in the Truc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle Bed, who lay all the time ſweating for fear, there fell firſt a little water, which made them begin to ſtir; but before they could get out, there came a whole Tub full, as it were of ſtinking Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water down upon them, ſo green that it made their Sheets and Shirts of the ſame colour too.</p>
            <p>The ſame night the Windows were all broken by throwing of Stones, and there were moſt terrible noiſes in three ſeveral places together, to the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary wonder of all that lodged near them. Nay, the very Coney-ſtealers that were abroad that night, were ſo affrighted with the diſmal Thundering that for haſt they leſt their Ferret in the Coney Burroughs behind them beyond <hi>Roſamond</hi>'s Wells; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, one of them had the boldneſs to ask, <hi>In the name of God, what it was? what it would have, and what they had done that they ſhould be diſturbed in this manner?</hi> To which no Anſwer was given, but the Noiſe ceaſed for a while; At length it came again, and as all of them ſaid, brought ſeven Devils worſe than it ſelf; whereupon one of them lighted a Candle again, and ſet it between the two Chambers in the door way, on which another of them fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his eyes, ſaw the ſimilitude of a hoof ſtriking the Candle and Candleſtick into the midſt of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and afterwards making three ſcrapes on the ſnuff to put it out. Upon this the ſame Perſon was ſo bold as to draw his Sword, but he had ſcarce got it out but there was another inviſible hand had hold of it too, and tugged with him for it, and getting it from him, ſtruck him ſo violently with the Pummel that he was ſtunned with the Blow; Then began grievous noiſes again, inſomuch that they called to

one another, got together, and went into the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence Chamber,</hi> where they ſaid Prayers and ſung Pſalmes, notwithſtanding all which the thundring noiſe ſtill continued in other Rooms. After this, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 3. they removed their Lodgings over the Gate; and next day being <hi>Sunday</hi> to <hi>Ewelm,</hi> but returning on Monday, the Devil, (for that was the name they gave their nightly Gueſt) left them not unviſited, nor on the Tueſday following, which was the laſt day they ſtayed. On Wedneſday the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners and their Dependants went quite away, and thoſe that lived at the place affirm, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſeveral Perſons of good quality lodged in the ſame room but were never diſturbed.</p>
            <p>I had ſeveral Relations of theſe ſtrange Paſſages (ſaith my Author) put into my hands, and one of them written by a learned and faithful Perſon then living upon the place, which being confirmed to me by ſeveral Eye-witneſſes of many of the particulars, and all of them by one of the Comiſſioners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who ingeniouſly confeſſed to me, that he could not deny but what was written by that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon above-mentioned was all true, I was prevailed on at laſt to make the Relation Publick, though I muſt confeſs, I have no great eſteem for ſuch kind of ſtories, many of them no queſtion being perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Combination, and ſo might ſome of theſe Tranſactions aforeſaid: But there are others which are ſcarce reconcileable to Contrivance or Jugling.

            <p n="22">XXII. The ſame ingenious Dr. <hi>Platt</hi> gives a Relation of another ſtrange and unaccountable accident, which he delivers with the ſame certainty as the former; That of the Family of one Captain <hi>Wood,</hi> formerly of <hi>Bampton,</hi> then of <hi>Briſe Norton</hi> in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the late Wars for the King; ſome of them have had ſignal warnings given them before their Deaths by a certain knocking either at the door without, or on the Tables and Shelves within, the number of Stroaks and diſtance between them, and the place where, for the moſt part reſpecting the Circumſtances of the Perſons to dye, or their deaths themſelves, as will eaſily be collected from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Inſtances; The firſt knocking that was heard or at leaſt obſerved, was about a year after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of the King, 1661, in the afternoon, a little before night, at or upon the door, it being then open, as it was apprehended by Mrs. <hi>Eleano Wood,</hi> Mother to Captain <hi>Baſil Wood,</hi> who only heard it, none being then by, or about the houſe but her ſelf, at which ſhe was very much diſturbed, thinking it foretold ſome ill to her, or hers, and within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days after ſhe had news of the death of her Son in Law, Mr. <hi>George Smith,</hi> who dyed in <hi>London.</hi> About three years after that, there were three great knocks very audibly given, and heard by all then in the houſe; who were Mrs. <hi>Eleanor Wood</hi> aforeſaid, Mr. <hi>Baſil Wood,</hi> and his Wife, Mrs. <hi>Heſter,</hi> and ſome Servants; which knocks were ſo remarkable, that one of the Maids came from the Well which was about 20 yards from the place, to ſee what was the

Vol. of Examples, which he intitles, A True and faithful Relation of one <hi>Samuel Wallas,</hi> who was reſtored to his perfect health after 13 years ſickneſs of a Conſumption, taken from his own mouth, who for the laſt four years lay bedrid, and ſo weak that he could not turn himſelf therein without help, by which Diſtemper his body was ſo parched and dryed that he was like an Anatomy, but upon this cure he recovered his former health and ſtrength, whereby he was inabled to follow his Trade being a Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and living at <hi>Stamford</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he gave this following Account with much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſenſibleneſs of Divine Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, upon <hi>April</hi> 7. 1659.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Whitſunday</hi> laſt before the date hereof, about ſix a Clock in the afternoon after evening Sermon, he finding himſelf a little lightſome, and able to get out of his Bed without help there being no body in the houſe then with him, his wife being gone in the Countrey to her Friends to ſeek ſome releif, he crept to the Fire-ſide, and as he was reading in a book called, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſuit for <hi>Sodom,</hi> he heard ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy rap at the door, and thinking it to be ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, becauſe he ſtruck as it were with a ſtick, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lords day; thereupon taking his ſtick in one hand, and holding by the Wall with the other, he went to the door and opening it, he ſaw a proper grave old man, who ſaid unto him, <hi>Friend I pray thee give to an old Pilgrim a Cup of ſmall Beer;</hi> to whom <hi>Wallas</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pray Sir come in;</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Call me not Sir for I am none, but yet come in I muſt, for I cannot paſs by thy door.</hi> To whom <hi>Wallas</hi> thinking he had been very dry, ſaid, <hi>Come in Sir and welcome,</hi> which he did, and <hi>Wallas</hi> with the help of his ſtick drew him a Cup of Beer, who took it and drank a little, and then walked two or three times to and fro, and drank again, and ſo a third time before he dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Wallas</hi> doubting the truth of theſe things ſaid to the old man, <hi>Sir, is it good for all Conſumptions?</hi> To which he replyed, <hi>I tell thee, I tell thee, obſerve what I ſay unto thee and do it, but above all, whatſoever thou doſt, Fear God and ſerve him.

ſake;</hi> To which <hi>Wallas</hi> replyed, <hi>what do you mean Sir by changing the Air;</hi> He anſwered, <hi>Thou muſt go three or four miles off, or if it be twenty miles, the farther the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this thou muſt do as ſpeedily as thou canſt after the twelve daies are over, or elſe thou wilt have a greivous fit of ſickneiſs which will ſuddenly ſeize upon thee, yet through Gods Mercy by doing this, thou maiſt avoid that, and thou ſhalt ſee that before the twelve dayes be ended, through the help of Almighty God thou wilt ſcarce be able to wear the Cloths now on thy back with eaſe, thy body will be grown ſo much, and I pray thee remember my words and obſerve to do them, but above all whatſoever thou doſt, Fear God and ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Wallas, Pray Sir if it ſhall pleaſe God to enable me to go into our own Fields two or three times a day will not that ſerve the turn;</hi> The old man anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Friend it will not, for that Air where the Infection is taken is not ſo proper for the Cure of the diſeaſe;</hi> ſaid <hi>Wallas, I thought to have been let bloud; No friend,</hi> ſaid the old man, <hi>by no means, for before thy twelve daies be expired thy bloud will be as good as ever it was in all thy life, yet this one thing obſerve, Thy joints will be weak as long as thou liveſt; Now Friend I muſt be going, pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I have ſaid and do it, but above all fear God and ſerve him.</hi> Then <hi>Wallas</hi> asked him to eat; But he refuſed ſaying, <hi>No Friend I will not eat any thing, the Lord Chriſt is ſufficient for me, neither do I drink any beer but very ſeldom, but that which comes from the Rock, and ſo friend the Lord in Heaven be with thee.</hi> When <hi>Wallas</hi> ſaw him go out of doors, he went to ſhut the door after him; But the old man returned half way into the entry again, and ſaid, <hi>Friend, I pray remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I have ſaid unto thee and do it, But above all whatſoever thou doſt, Fear God and ſerve him;</hi> and ſo they parted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samuel Wallas</hi> ſaith, he ſaw him paſs along the ſtreets ſome ſixty yards from his door, and ſo he went in; But this old man was not ſeen to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

the Streets by any one elſe, though ſome Perſons were ſtanding in their doors oppoſite to <hi>Wallas</hi> his houſe; After <hi>Wallas</hi> had made uſe of the leaves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned about four days, there aroſe a Scurff upon his Body, and when that was gone a new skin came under it like that of a ſucking Child, and by the end of the twelve days he was as healthful and ſtrong as ever he had been, only he ſaid when he went to ſit down his knees would ſmite together, ſo that he ſtill found a weakneſs in his joints as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him; He ſaid likewiſe that one day within the time preſcribed by the ſollicitation of ſome Friends he drank a little ſtrong drink, and immediately his Speech was taken from him for the ſpace of 24 hours. As for the Deſcription of this old mans Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Habit, he thus related it; He was tall and Ancient, his hair as white as Wool curled up, with a white broad beard, and of a freſh Complexion, he wore a faſhionable Hat, and a little narrow band; His Coat and Hoſe were both of a purple Colour, his Stockings pure, with a pair of new black ſhoes tyed with Ribbons of the ſame Colour with his Cloths, and though it rained when he came into <hi>Wallas</hi> his houſe and all that day, as many remembred, yet he had not one ſpot of wet or dirt upon him; He had no Gloves, but his hands were as white as Snow; This ſtrange accident being related abroad, ſeveral Reverend Divines met together about it at <hi>Stamford,</hi> to conſider and conſult about it, and for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſaith Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> were induced to believe that this Cure was wrought by the Miniſtry of a good Angel. <hi>Clark's Mirrour, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. I will add one Hiſtory more of this kind which I find related in a <hi>German</hi> Author; In the year 1626, there was in <hi>Sileſia</hi> one <hi>Chriſtopher Cotterus,</hi> whom the Famous <hi>German</hi> Divine, <hi>Johannes Comenius</hi> judges to be a Prophet; This man had many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

and among the reſt one <hi>David Wacksman,</hi> the Emperors Prefect for gathering his Tributes in the lower <hi>Sileſta,</hi> and <hi>Luſatia;</hi> He ſwore that he would never reſt till he ſaw <hi>Cotterus,</hi> and <hi>Mincelius</hi> a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Miniſter hanged upon the ſame Gallows in the City of <hi>Sprotovia</hi> where they lived; Their Friends informed them hereof, which cauſed them with greater fervency to commend themſelves to God; yet <hi>Cotterus</hi> by a ſtrong Impulſe of Spirit reſolved to go to <hi>Glogow,</hi> and though his Friends would have diſſwaded him, yet <hi>Jan.</hi> 2. 1627, he went thither, where being known he was apprehended, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Count of <hi>Opperſdorf,</hi> and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Prefect, who after Examination committed them to Priſon. The next day a Commiſſary was ſent to <hi>Sprotovia,</hi> with a Command to the Senate that he ſhould before ſome of them ſearch all the houſe and Coffers of <hi>Cotterus,</hi> for writings, and like-<hi>Mencelius</hi> his houſe in the ſame manner; This was done, and the Writings were by the Commiſſary car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to them, which they read and examined, but all his Prophecies were not found; <hi>January</hi> 25, <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> was again examined more ſtrictly whence he had thoſe Prophecies, He anſwered, <hi>Not from any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man, but from spirits that uſed to appear to him, but whether they were Good or Bad Angels, he left it to the learned to judge;</hi> The Count upon certain Conditions would have releaſed him, but the Prefect ſtrongly oppoſing it, charged him with Treaſon againſt the Emperor, and required that <hi>Mincelius</hi> might likewiſe be ſent for; The Senate ſent with him two of their Magiſtrates, in whoſe preſence <hi>Mincelius</hi> was charged to be guilty of Death (who it ſeems writ out thoſe Prophecies) which they ſaid were Lyes, and to the great diſhonour of the Emperor; <hi>Mincelius</hi> pleaded, <hi>That he was enjoyned by the Senate to do it,</hi> which the Magiſtrates alſo affirmed. The Prefect appealed then to the Council of <hi>Prague,</hi> and commanded that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63178:40"/>
               <hi>Mincelius</hi> ſhould be kept under an Arreſt till he had anſwered them; The Conſuls that came with him proteſted againſt this, affirming, <hi>That their City could not want his Miniſtry,</hi> offering to ſtand bound for his appearance and at length they prevailed after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given a Bond of Two Thouſand Crowns for his forth coming.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Prefect poured out all his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Cotterus,</hi> removing him from his former Priſon into a Dungeon where Malefactors uſed to be Tortured, wherein he lay in Hunger, Dirt and Cold for above three Months; Now a ſpecial Providence from Heaven appeared, For <hi>Cotterus</hi> his Enemies underſtood that a compleat Book of all his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was in the hand of a Citizen of <hi>Sprotovia;</hi> This they got, and carried it to the Governour of <hi>Opperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorf,</hi> who after he had read it, was much taken with <hi>Cotterus,</hi> and would no more meddle againſt him; He alſo perſwaded the Prefect to have his cauſe heard in the City of <hi>Glogow,</hi> and prevailed that <hi>Cotterus</hi> ſhould have an Advocate allowed him. In the mean time the Prefect married a Noble Virgin, and at the weeks end his Office neceſſitated him to go <hi>Sagan,</hi> and in his return he was to lye at <hi>Sprotovia;</hi> but as ſoon as he came into the Suburbs of that City, he was taken with a violent pain in his Bowels; whereupon he ſent for a Phyſitian, who not knowing what to make of his Diſeaſe, forbore to adminiſter any thing to him till the next Morning that he might ſee farther. But it pleaſed God the Praefect died that night, and in that very place where he had ſworn to ſee theſe men hanged. This dreadful Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being known to the Enemies of <hi>Cotterus,</hi> they removed him out of the Dungeon into a better Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and after ſome Months ſpace they ſentenced him, and brought him to the Town-Stocks, faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Collar of Iron about his Neck, and ſet over his head a Paper thus written; <hi>This is the falſe Prophet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63178:41"/>
which foretold ſuch things as came not to paſs;</hi> There he ſtood an hour, after which he was baniſhed out of all the Emperors Dominions upon pain of death.</p>
            <p>From hence he went to <hi>Luſatia</hi> under the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> where he lived quietly till the day of his death, which was in the year 1647. But before this, that is in 1628 when the Perſecution grew hot in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> there was in the City of <hi>Spretovia,</hi> one <hi>Adam Pohl,</hi> a good Friend to <hi>Cotterus,</hi> who knowing the great want, and neceſſity he was brought unto, not through any fault of his own but by Gods Providence, he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him at his houſe <hi>gratis,</hi> and <hi>Cotterus</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him by the ſpace of half a year to the time of his Impriſonment. During which time <hi>Adam Pohl</hi> fell dangerouſly ſick, and after a while had his Nerves and Sinews ſo ſhrunk up, that he could make no uſe of his Legs, but for a half a year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was confined to his Bed; But it pleaſed God that the very morning before the Emperours Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners came with Armed Troops to reform the City (as they called it) his Wife being riſen and gone down, there appeared by his Bedſide a young man in white Clothing, who after he had ſaluted him, ſaid, Adam, <hi>This is the day wherein God hath decreed to take Vengeance upon the Citizens of this City for their Ingratitude, Ariſe go in the name of the Lord, put on thy Cloths, take thy wife and young Daughter, and fly from hence, make haſt;</hi> and ſo he diſappeared; After which <hi>Pohl</hi> prayed earneſtly, and then began to move his hands and feet, and trying to riſe, found that he could ſtand on his feet, whereupon he called to his Wife for his Cloths, which had been laid up in a Cheſt all that half year of his lameneſs, and when he was dreſt, he fell down on his knees and praiſed God; Then taking his Wife and Daughter, he haſted to the City-gate, and having ſent for <hi>Mincelius</hi> to meet him there (who was aſtoniſhed to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63178:41"/>
ſee him) with ſighs and Tears they took Council together, and reſolved to go to <hi>Gorlits</hi> (and by Gods ſtrength, and as he judged the Miniſtry of an Angel,) he and his little Daughter went afoot eight miles that day. <hi>Hiſtoria Prophetarum. pag.</hi> 22.</p>

Three Leagues from <hi>Breda,</hi> the River falls into a large Channel in <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome Barks of Merchandiſe uſed to paſs to and fro upon that River, having Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for that purpoſe; The Governor of <hi>Breda</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> uſed ſometimes to go to a place about nine Miles off, and in his abſence his Son commanded in his ſtead; All the while the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept in <hi>Breda,</hi> he ſtill cauſed diligent ſearch to be made in every Boat that paſſed, leſt by ſome trick or other he might be ſurprized, but his Son being young and inexperienced was neither ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate nor careful as he ſhould have been.

Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> liked the Stratagem very well, and reſolved to make Trial of it. Theſe Turf-boats are uſually of a good length, thereby to ſupply their want of breadth, the leſſer Rivers and Channels not being capable of Broader, The Boat being fitted, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter came with it to <hi>Breda,</hi> and underneath the Turf which was upheld by great Poles, were placed four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Souldiers all choice men, and Captain <hi>Charles Harawger</hi> an old and Valiant Souldier commanded them; The Bark being come into the Caſtle, the young Governour gave Order that it ſhould be ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched according to Cuſtom, but as that order was careleſly given, ſo it was careleſly executed; The Marriners hereby encouraged, paſſed from more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

            <p>The day now declining, to prevent the infinite miſchief that was like to enſue, it was thought fit by ſome, that the Monks and Fryers ſhould go in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through the City to implore the Divine help and if poſſible to quiet the People, which accordingly they did but without ſucceſs; But the Vice-Roy and Nobility fearing the People ſhould ſieze upon 16 pieces of Ordnance, Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Ring the Bells to encreaſe the Uproar, they ſent a good guard of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and others to prevent them; and about Mid-night the Vice Roy and other principal men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the Caſtle <hi>Nuovo,</hi> that was near the Palace,

and the better to quiet the People, he publiſhed good Orders concerning bread, which being ſcarce 24 Ounces, ſhould now be made above 33 Ounces, and that Conſiderable Guards ſhould be ſet about the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; yet the People went on with their Fury, Ringing Bells, and dividing themſelves into all Quarters; Some burning down the reſt of the Toll-Houſes; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers plundering the Shops for Swords, Muſquets, Bullets, Match, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And one fooliſh Man reſiſting them, they put Fire to his houſe wherein were divers Barrels of Powder, which taking Fire blew up 87 Men, beſides 44 that were hurt; To prevent the like miſchief the Vice-Roy commanded, that all the Powder in other places ſhould be made wet with water.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>July</hi> 8. very early in the morning the People appeared in a warlike Equipage, amongſt whom were mingled many Countrey Fellows with pitchforks, plowſhares, ſhovels, and the like, and many Women with Fire-ſhovels, Tongs, Spits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea the very Children with little Staves and Canes all in an enraged manner crying out; <hi>Let the Lord our King live, and the ill Government die;</hi> With ſuch like cryes the Air w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder, they went to a Houſe where they knew ſome was, who refuſing to ſell it them, they threw lighted Matches into it, blowing up the Houſe and ſixty Perſons that were in it; Then they haſtned to the Kings Powderhouſe that was out of the City, but when they came thither found it all put in Water, and ſo were diſappointed; In the mean time the Vice-Roy had ſtrengthened his Guards with a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Germans,</hi> eight hundred <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Italians,</hi> fortifying all places about him; He ſent alſo for another Regiment of <hi>Germans</hi> from <hi>Poz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolo,</hi> which the People hearing of met them, ſlew ſome and took the reſt Priſoners; That morning alſo

               <hi>Julio Genovino,</hi> were joined in Aſſiſtance to <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanello;</hi> The firſt order they made, was to burn down the Houſes of Sixty Perſons who had been Projectors and Officers in the Cuſtom-houſes, and had inriched themſelves by the blood of the people; This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſo ſtrictly, that one for taking a little Towel out of thoſe Houſes was killed, another for a Horſe-crouper had Fifty laſhes on his back, and ſome others for ſmall Trifles were hanged by the Command of <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> and he that pityed the burning of thoſe mens Houſes or Goods was held no friend to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the houſes were very ſtately, out of which they threw all ſorts of Plate, Diſhes, Stools, Tables, Chairs, Carpets, Tapeſtry, and abundance of Money, all which they carried into the Market place, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, crying out; <hi>Theſe goods are our blood, and as theſe burn, ſo the Souls of thoſe Dogs that own them deſerve to burn in Hell-fire;</hi> In one of theſe Palaces, beſides all ſorts of rich Furniture, were brought out Twenty Three great Trunks, which were full of Rich Cloth of Gold, Tiſſue, coſtly Embroideries, that dazled the Eyes of the Beholders, a Cabinet of Pearls and Precious Stones, yet nothing was ſaved from the fire;</p>
            <p>The Vice Roy being deſirous to put an end to theſe Combuſtions and Burnings, ſent a Printed Inſtrument for aboliſhing all Gabels with a General Pardon, which took no effect, becauſe the pardon was not ſo full as they deſired; but percieving that the Nobility in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral were hated, he reſolved to employ two Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of the people, committing to their care and prudence the quieting of them, who told him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would quiet them, unleſs the Original Charter of Priviledges granted by <hi>Charles</hi> 5 were delivered to them, which he therefore ordered to be ſearcht out; In the mean time <hi>Maſſanello</hi> commanded all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in the Name of the people to be ready in Arms for their ſervice; And himſelf went with his Train to all the Houſes of the Gentry, and others, to ſearch

for Arms, taking all they found of all ſorts, which were many Thouſands, with Nine Pieces of Ordnance, Two Canons they took out of a Ship, and Seven more out of another; all which they planted at the mouths of Principal Streets; Thus ended the ſecond day, the Sun ſcarce appearing on the third Morning, when the enraged People ran to the houſe of a Rich Farmer of the Gabel upon Corn; and it is incredible what a world of Goods, very precious both for quantity and quality, were found in his houſe, all which they burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Aſhes, only two Boxes of Gold were preſerved and depoſited in the King's Bank; Then went they to the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> who was Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Kingdom, where they burned his Books, Writings and Library, with infinite ſtore of Rich Moveables and Utenſils, Coaches, Sedans, Couches, rare ſilver Veſſels and Jewels of all kinds, ſtore of Curious Pictures, all which were burned, ſave ſome that they ſent to Churches as counting them holy pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet burned their Rich Frames; and haraſſed the houſe to the ground; The fire was ſo great that it took hold of a Neighbouring Monaſtery of Nuns, and burnt down a gallant Library; The like Deſolations were made in all houſes that <hi>Maſſanello</hi> appointed to deſtruction, which were many of the ſtatelieſt in all <hi>Naples;</hi> In one of them was found an ineſtimable Wardrobe, fit for a King, which was all deſtroyed; Others hid their Richeſt Moveables in Monaſteries, which were by the command of <hi>Maſſanello</hi> brought out and burned.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the People were thus revenging themſelves on their ſuppoſed Adverſaries, by the diligence of thoſe that were imployed, the Original Charters of their Priviledges were found out; which being carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Vice Roy, he immediately ſent them word of it, promiſing all ſatisfaction, but they finding that delayes were made, demanded to be Maſters of the Tower, where the great Bell hung to ſound to war at any time, as alſo of a Port which they thought

might be prejudicial to them, and to have the uſe of the Artillery, and Arms of the City therein, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could have an anſwer, Ten Thouſand of them Beſieged and Aſſaulted the Tower, forcing the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to depart, leaving all their Arms behind them; Then by the Command of <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> the great Bell was rung, and the Arms brought forth, yet with a Proteſtation, <hi>That they intended not to rebel, but only to ſecure the people;</hi> The Charter not yet appearing, the People grew ſo furious that they drew forth other goods to be burnt, amongſt which they found the Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the then King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Rich Canopy, crying aloud, <hi>Let God live, let our King live, and let the ill Government dye;</hi> Then they planted many pieces of Ordnance in all places, and ſet Guards, and amongſt their Company marched many women in Warlike Equipage, like ſo many Amazons, and after them little Girls with battoons and ſticks in their hands, and amongſt all ſeveral <hi>Banditi</hi> or thieves mingled themſelves, under a pretence to help the people, but indeed to inrich themſelves by plunder, or plot ſome Treaſon.</p>
            <p>During theſe ſtirs they kept all Proviſions our of the Caſtle where the Vice-Roy was, and being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters both of Sea and Land, they held him as it were Beſieged; So that he at laſt delivered the Original Charter to the Archbiſhop, together with a Writing, wherein the Vice Roy promiſed firmly to obſerve it; With theſe he went to the Market place, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to give them ſatisfaction, and probably he had done it, but that at the ſame inſtant a Conſpiracy was diſcovered for the cutting off <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> and when the Charter came to be read, they ſuſpected it not to be real, whereupon the Archbiſhop was in danger of his Life, but he told <hi>Maſſanello</hi> it was the right, and one was appointed to examine it all night, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened well for ſome, for otherwiſe thirty ſix ſtately Houſes were appointed to have been burned down, but at the requeſt of the Archbiſhop, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

Market place, with two more that aſſiſted him, gave publick Audience, recieving from all ſorts, whether Laicks, or Eccleſiaſticks, Petitions, Memorials; paſſing orders, decreeing Civil, Criminal, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Sentences, and had at his command an Army of an Hundred and Fifty Thouſand Men, beſides Women and Boys, who were an incredible number, and thus ended the Third day, which was Tueſday.</p>
            <p>The Fourth day early in the Morning, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> commanded his Life-guard, conſiſting of Seven or Eight Thouſand men, to repair upon pain of death to the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted one of the Peoples greateſt enemies, and again to plunder his houſe, notice being given of far richer goods than were before diſcovered; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when they had broken it open, they found two Chambers full of the richeſt Tapeſtry that could be ſeen, with much other coſtly goods, then they went into his Gardens, where they brake the Marble Statues, grubbed up the Trees, Flowers, &amp;c. and putting fire to ſeveral places, they burnt the houſe, and all down to the ground; From thence they went to the Palace of the young Duke his Son, to get the reſidue of his Fathers Goods, preſerved happily by him, and ruſhing in, they miſerably ſpoiled every thing; and to quicken them the Women and Boys brought Faggots, Pitch, Oyl and Straw, crying out, <hi>We have but this little Straw left in our Houſes, and it ſhall ſerve to burn down the Kennels of theſe Dogs, who have impoſed and exacted theſe curſed Taxes and Gabels from us, and thereby ſucked out our blood;</hi> Other Women would bring their Children in their Arms, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fired Matches into their hands, they would make them throw them into the fire, ſaying, <hi>Theſe poor Lambs ſhall take vengeance on theſe Thieves, for the bread which they have taken out of their Mouths;</hi> Yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they added, <hi>Let God live for ever, and our King, and let theſe Dogs dye the death;</hi> While the People thus vented their diſcontents, the Arch-Biſhop had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

with the Vice-Roy for a Pacification, and it was agreed, that the Vice-Roy and Nobles ſhould come to the Church of <hi>Carmine,</hi> and there Treat with <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello,</hi> who conſented to it, yet charged the People upon pain of Death to maintain their Station; The Vice-Roy in the mean time ſent an Inſtrument, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he confirmed all the Peoples Priviledges, which the Archbiſhop having recieved, He requeſted <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> to call together all the Captains of the People to hear it read; and there were great hopes of a final Concluſion, which yet again was interrupted by this Accident; <hi>Peronne</hi> who was <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s Aſſiſtant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring, with the Duke of <hi>Mataloni</hi> and his Brother, to deſtroy <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> hoping that then he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſperſe the People, had ſent five Hundred <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti,</hi> who juſt then entred at one of the Gates on Horſeback, and being brought before <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> they pretended to come for the Service of the People; <hi>Maſſanello</hi> welcomed them, and ordered them to ſerve in ſeveral Places on Foot; But <hi>Peronne</hi> would have them keep altogether on Horſeback, whereupon <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſuſpecting ſomewhat, commanded peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, that they ſhould be on Foot, and keep the place which he aſſigned them to; The <hi>Banditi</hi> being vexed at this, diſcharged ſeven Harquebuſs Shot at him, but all miſſed him, though ſome of the Bullets burnt part of his Shirt, which was eſteemed a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; The People being herewith inraged, fell upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

and would have perſwaded his Brother to have done the like, but he refuſed, and being taken by ſome of the Rabble, he offered them twelve Thouſand pound in Gold to let him eſcape, but a Butchers Son with a great Knife cut his Throat, and chopped off his head, which was fixed upon a Pike, with this Inſcription <hi>This is Don</hi> Caraffa<hi>'s head, a Rebel to his Countrey, and a Traytor to the moſt Faithful People;</hi> They uſed his Body alſo very deſpitefully, as alſo of four others his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, whom they murthered with him, The head being carried to <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> he plucked him often by the Whiskers, uſing many opprobrious words againſt him and made a Speech to the People, wherein <hi>He told them of the Juſtice of God which comes ſurely though ſlowly to puniſh the Guilty,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>At this Spectacle of <hi>Caraffa,</hi> the Cavaliers were much troubled, fearing leaſt the People would deſtroy them all, who were now increaſed to the Number of one hundred and Forty Thouſand Fighting men; <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſuppoſing that the Vice-Roy had a hand in bringing in the <hi>Banditi,</hi> cut off all Proviſions, and water from the Caſtle, whereby he, his Dutcheſs, his Council and Nobles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> began to find themſelves to be in an ill condition; whereupon the Vice-Roy ſent a Letter to the Archbiſhop, deſiring him to make known to the People his ſincere Intentions toward them, and that he was not only a ſtranger but an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the Practices of the <hi>Banditi,</hi> and that if he could catch any of them he would deliver them to the People; This the Arch-Biſhop did, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what allayed the Fury of the People, yet <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſuſpecting that there was a Plot to bring in more <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti</hi> to join with the Souldiers for ſurpriſing the City, he cauſed Barricadoes to be made at the end of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Street, that one only might paſs by them at a

            <p>This Morning likewiſe he cauſed the great Guns to be mounted, and planted in the moſt advantageous places of the City, and Guards of Horſe and Foot placed near them; He commanded all Noble men, and Gentlemen to deliver their Arms to perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, upon pain of death, and though this might expoſe them to the fury of the people, yet they durſt not diſobey; He alſo ſet a rate upon all edible Commodities; But now by the mediation of the Archbiſhop, Articles were drawn up between the Vice-Roy and the People, whereby their Priviledges were confirmed, and a general pardon granted, <hi>and the people were acknowledged for the King's Children, and the moſt Loyal Subjects he had in all his Dominions;</hi> About

ſaid he, <hi>I was offered Two Hundred Crowns a Month, all the time of my life, if I would have deſiſted, but I do refuſe it; Moreover if the Archbiſhop had not enjoyned me, and threatned me with Excommunication, I would not have apparelled my ſelf as you now ſee me, I would never have altered my Seamans Cloths, ſuch a one I was born, ſuch a one I lived, and ſuch a one I mean to dye, after I have once Eſtabliſhed the publick Liberty; But yet lay not down your Arms, till a Confirmation comes from the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>Truſt not the Nobles they are Traytors, and our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which he went into the Caſtle, and upon the Stairs the Vice-Roy met him, to whom he humbled himſelf, thanking him for condeſcending to their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, telling him, <hi>That he might diſpoſe of him as he pleaſed, either to hang him, break him on the Wheel, or any other kind of death;</hi> But the Vice-Roy raiſed him up, telling him, <hi>That he knew not that he had committed any fault, nor had offended his Majeſty, and therefore he ſhould be cheerful, and that he ſhould alwayes reſpect him;</hi> And herewith he often embraced him; Whilſt they were conſulting together, a rumor aroſe among that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of people which ſtaid without; That <hi>Maſſanello</hi> was arreſted, or ſome hurt done to him, therefore the Vice-Roy took him with the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop unto a Balcony, where he might be ſeen of all, who looking on the people, ſaid to them, <hi>Lo I am here, I am alive and free, Peace, Peace,</hi> at which the multitude exceedingly rejoyced; Then ſaid <hi>Maſſanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> to the Vice-Roy; <hi>My Lord, you ſhall ſee how obedient the People be,</hi> and ſo he bid them cry, <hi>Let God live, let the King of</hi> Spain <hi>live,</hi> &amp;c. which they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did; and then he added, <hi>Let the ill Government dye,</hi> they all cryed ſo likewiſe; Then putting his finger to his mouth, there was a profound univerſal ſilence, that ſcarce a man was ſeen to breath; He then with a loud voice commanded, that every one there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould depart from that Court, under pain of Rebellion and Death, which was punctually and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obeyed, whereat the Vice-Roy was much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63178:69"/>
After many diſcourſes it was agreed, <hi>That the Peoples demands ſhould be printed, and ſubſcribed by the Vice-Roy and all his Councils, and that the Sunday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſhould all come to the Cathedral, and there ſwear to obſerve them for ever;</hi> as alſo to procure the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof from his Catholick Majeſty, after which <hi>Maſſanello</hi> took leave to depart; At his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Vice-Roy gave him a rich Chain of Gold worth three thouſand Crowns, putting it about his neck with his own hands, and declared him to be the Duke of St. <hi>George,</hi> both which he would have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that the Archbiſhop adviſed him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Maſſanello</hi> then went with the Archbiſhop to his Palace, and whilſt they were diſcourſing together, a Rumour was ſpread that many of the <hi>Banditi</hi> were coming into the City, but it proved to be the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of St. <hi>Ermo,</hi> who with his Followers returned from his Countrey houſe to the City; yet had the jealous People almoſt pulled him to peices had not <hi>Maſſanello</hi> at the requeſt of a Lady interpoſed for his ſafety, and ſo ended the fifth day being Thurſday, <hi>July,</hi> 11. 1647.</p>
            <p>On Friday Morning there came a Boat with 6 Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, and four men compleatly armed, which brought Letters from the Duke of <hi>Mataloni</hi> to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, and becauſe they were written in dark Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> cauſed the four men firſt to be racked, and then to have their heads chopped off. The ſame morning he erected another Tribunal of Juſtice, ſubſtituting a Leiutenant under him, who preſently condemned four <hi>Banditi,</hi> and beheaded them. <hi>Maſſanello</hi> alſo having left off his Cloth of Silver, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his old Mariners habit, and yet was obeyed and feared by every one. He ſtood in a Window to give Audience, and to receive Petitions, which they reached up to him upon the ends of Pikes; All his Orders ran in theſe words, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder pain of Rebellion and Death;</hi> and it was wonderful to ſee ſo many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Bans, Commiſſions and Orders publiſhed

and affixed to Poſts ſubſcribed, Thomas Anello <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General of the moſt faithful People of</hi> Naples; all which were executed with incredible readineſs and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; This morning he iſſued out an order, <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould cut off his great Lock, and wear no Perriwigs;</hi> He likewiſe renewed his former Order, <hi>That Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not wear their upper Garment, becauſe by that means many</hi> Banditi <hi>came into the City.</hi> There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order, <hi>That upon ſounding the two a Clock Bell in the night, every one upon pain of death ſhould retire to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> And becauſe many of the Nobility and Ladies were retired into the Monaſteries and Nunneries, he commanded, <hi>That upon pain of death they ſhould all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Houſes,</hi> which was preſently obeyed; Then he commanded, <hi>That all the Inhabitants both Natives and Forreigners ſhould ſet upon their Gates the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s Arms on the right hand, and the City Arms on the left;</hi> which was ſuddenly put in Execution, though with much trouble to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Many Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents were put to death; He cauſed a Baker to be baked to death, becauſe he made his bread too light. He had ſeven Secetaries, and ten Officers to puniſh whom he pleaſed, and he was feared and obeyed with as much exactneſs as if it had been the <hi>Great Turk,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Choice Horſe being ſent <hi>Maſſanello</hi> worth four Hundred Ducats, he ſent him preſently to the Kings Stable, ſaying, <hi>That he was too good for his uſe;</hi> There were about an hundred Thouſand Crowns diſcovered in a By-place, which he cauſed to be reſerved for the Kings Uſe, withal offering the Vice-Roy five Millions, if need were; Many great Preſents being ſent him from Gentlemen, he would not receive the value of one farthing; He employed many to ſearch after the Servants and Kindred of the Duke of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> and his Brother; and when they were brought to him, he examined them upon the Rack where their Perſons and Goods were, and at laſt one confeſſing that their Goods were hidden in ſeveral Churches and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; He cauſed them immediately to be ſearcht for,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63178:70"/>
both above and under ground, whence were brought forth abundance of rich things, valued at five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Crowns, beſides four Thouſand Crowns in ready Money; all which being brought to <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello,</hi> he employed the Money to pay his Souldiers and laid up the Goods in a Magazine, none daring to touch a Rag of it; He ſent alſo to make a new ſearch in the Houſes whence he had formerly taken and burnt their Goods, and found much more in Wells, Pits, Houſes of Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with great quantities of Silver and Gold; He ſent alſo armed men into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to burn the Houſe, Goods, and Furniture of the the Duke of <hi>Caivano,</hi> which was done accordingly, as alſo the Palace of <hi>Mataloni,</hi> with all that was within, whom likewiſe they hanged in <hi>Effigie</hi> in the Market-place, becauſe they could not catch his Perſon; Then he commanded them to burn the Goods of divers other Officers, and particularly of the Kings Viſitors; yet at the requeſt of the Archbiſhop it was not put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; In the mean time the Vice-Roy being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in his Caſtle and deprived of Proviſions, he ſent to <hi>Maſſanello</hi> for ſome ſupply, which he readily conſented to, ſending him 50 Porters loaden with all ſorts of Proviſion, and Shops were opened, and all People went up and down with as much ſecurity, as if there had been no Souldiers, nor diſturbance in the City, ſo ſtrict and rigorous was he in the Execution of Juſtice; At the ſame time 13 Gallies of <hi>Naples</hi> arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Port, their Admiral ſent to the Vice-Roy for a ſupply of Proviſions; But he ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> who promiſed them a ſupply, but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they ſhould go farther off, and none of them come aſhore, which was done accordingly; Preſently after, came divers from the Caſtle, bringing Preſents from the Vice-Roy to <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> with Thanks for the plentiful proviſion he had ſent him, amongſt which was a Rich Suit of Clothes for his own wearing; The Vice-Queen alſo ſent to know how he did, deſiring him for her ſake to make uſe of the things that were ſent him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:63178:71"/>Saturday, <hi>July</hi> 13. <hi>Maſſanello</hi> knowing that his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſted in keeping the people in exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which hitherto he had done; he puniſhed the leaſt Act of diſobedience with death, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the night before, ſome were employed in going about amongſt the Shop-keepers, to make them ſenſible of their ſlavery under him; He ſent out ſtrict orders for apprehending them, and hanged them up before the ſhops where they had been, and among them two of the Duke of <hi>Mataloni's</hi> Servants were hanged, who had brought Letters in the ſoles of their ſhoes, written in Cyphers, which none could underſtand; Then being informed of a Burglary which was committed that night, and that it was done by ſome <hi>Banditi,</hi> who had taken Sanctuary in a Church, he cauſed them to be dragged out, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; A Young Maid complained to him, that one of his Souldiers had Murthered her Father, whereupon the Brother of the Murtherer promiſed, that if the fault might be remitted, he would Marry the Maid; but ſhe refuſing, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> cauſed him to give her Two Hundred Crowns for a Dowry, and ſo pardoned him; Now Intelligence being brought, that the <hi>Banditi</hi> were joyned together in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to invade the City; He made Proclamation, <hi>That what</hi> Banditi <hi>ſoever ſhould diſcover the Plot; he ſhould be abſolutely pardoned;</hi> and a Meſſage of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence being brought him by a Cavalier; He ſaid, <hi>I will have nothing to do with the Cavaliers, God hath ſet me up for the peoples good;</hi> and turning to them, he ſaid, <hi>My People pray for me, and preſerve me well, for if you loſe me, woe be to you;</hi> The ſame Morning came in multitudes of People out of the Countrey round about, and amongſt them, Women and Children, with ſwords and ſtaves to do their Homage to <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello,</hi> and to be redreſſed by him of their grievances; About the ſame time he ſent to the Vice-Roy, to mind him of his promiſe of coming the next day, being Sunday, with all his Councellors, to confirm
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63178:71"/>
his grants by all their Oaths, which accordingly was done; For after dinner the Vice-Roy ſent two of his beſt Horſes with rich Furniture for <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> and his Brother, who mounting upon them, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtle, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> carrying in one hand a naked ſword, and in the other the Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> 5. Emperor; His Brother carryed the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made with the Vice-Roy, and being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a huge number of people, they arrived at the Caſtle, and being Conducted into the Pallace, they entertain themſelves a while with the Vice-Roy; And then all returned into the City with the Vice-Roy, and all his Councellors; The ſtreets were clean ſwept by <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s Command, and the Houſes adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Richeſt Hangings; and thus they went to the Archbiſhops Palace, the People crying all the way as they went, <hi>Let the King of</hi> Spain <hi>live; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gabels;</hi> At the Arch-Biſhops Palace they all alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were met by him, and his Chaplains, in their Robes, and ſo going into the Church, and kneeling at the High Altar, the Secretary of the Kingdom read the Articles with a loud voice, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſtanding by, and to the wonderment of all, added, altered, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and interpreted them at his pleaſure, no man preſuming to contradict him; After which the Vice-Roy, with all the Officers of State, ſwore to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and keep the ſaid Capitulations to perpetuity, and to get them confirmed by Oath of his Catholick Majeſty; After which followed Muſick, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung for this good agreement.</p>
            <p>When all was ended, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> told them, <hi>That in the laſt ſixteen years the King of</hi> Spain <hi>had had of them above an Hundred Millions, but that the greateſt part of it was conſumed by his Officers, who enriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the Kings and Peoples loſſes, which he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to redreſs for the time to come, and thereby prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a faithful Subject, and Friend to the King;</hi> Which he ſpoke with ſuch earneſtneſs, that all the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude gave him a loud applauſe; Thus buſineſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63178:72"/>
finiſhed, he attended the Vice-Roy and his train back to the Caſtle, where all the Ordnance was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and <hi>Maſſanello</hi> told them, <hi>That having now brought his honeſt intents to paſs, he would return to be a Fiſherman;</hi> and ſo tearing off his garments of Silver, he returned with all the People to the Market place, who wonderfully rejoyced for having thus attained their deſires. This day being Sunday <hi>July</hi> 14. the Papers of the agreement were fixed up and down in all parts of <hi>Naples,</hi> which cauſed not only great joy in the hearts of the people, but every one extolled <hi>Maſſanello</hi> as the Inſtrument, and next to him the Archbiſhop, as the Mediator of that accord; And it was no ſmall aſtoniſhment in the minds of many, to conſider that ſuch great things were effected, not by the power of a Mighty Emperour, and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, but by the conduct of a poor bare legged Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-boy; Now though peace ſeemed to be ſetled, yet it was not judged fit preſently to diſmiſs the Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, therefore <hi>Maſſanello</hi> commanded them to ſtand firm to their Guard; and withal made Proclamation, <hi>That every one upon pain of death ſhould diſcover if any goods were depoſited in their hands, of thoſe whoſe houſes had been burnt;</hi> Whereupon much wealth was brought out of Churches, Monaſteries, Hoſpitals and Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries, and being informed that four <hi>Banditi</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Sanctuary among the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> he ſent ſome to fetch them thence, who having forced open the doors, found them, and chopped off their heads, and a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> zealous of the Churches Priviledges, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome reſiſtance, they ſo wounded him that he preſently after dyed; Notice being likewiſe given of much Goods hid in a Nunnery, he ſent ſome Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fetch it into the Market place to be burnt, the Captains being denyed entrance, forced the doors, and ſo behaved themſelves, that one of the Nuns almoſt dyed through fear; which the Arch-Biſhop complaining of to <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> he ſent for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and after Examination beheaded them; The
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63178:72"/>
ſame Morning he publiſhed a Proclamation, <hi>That none ſhould go out of the City without his Licenſe;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Severine</hi> being to go into his Dioceſs went without a Cloke, according to former Order, to <hi>Maſſanello</hi> for a Paſs; <hi>Maſſanello</hi> when he ſaw him, ſaid, <hi>What wilt thou have my fine Lord? I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with your good leave</hi> (ſaith the Archbiſhop) <hi>that I may ſafely paſs to my Church; Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and let four hundred of my men go to guard you thither; It needs not,</hi> ſaid the Archbiſhop, <hi>for I go by Sea; Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Let forty Barges be provided to attend you; I have,</hi> ſaid the Archbiſhop, <hi>four already for my Family which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; Well,</hi> ſaid <hi>Maſſanello, you may do your pleaſure, yet you ſhall not refuſe this bag of double Piſtoles to bear your charges.</hi> The Archbiſhop would have refuſed them, but he forced five hundred upon him, which he durſt not but accept for fear of angering him.</p>
            <p>The ſame morning alſo he cauſed a Bakers houſe to be burnt for making bread too light, and chopped off the head of an Abbot and ſome others, as being De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants upon the Duke of <hi>Matalone;</hi> He ſent to the Jeſuites and other Religious Orders, for a great ſum of Money for the Service of the People; He ſent to many Rich Men, and cauſed them to bind themſelves to pay great Sums that he might make good his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of a Donative of ſix Millions of Gold; This Morning a Kinſman of <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s in whom he much confided went to the Palace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining openly, <hi>That</hi> Maſſanello <hi>began to dote,</hi> and a Chaplain of the Archbiſhop came to him from his Lord, deſiring him now things were at peace to disband his Souldiers, and to retire himſelf a while into a pleaſant Iſland (whither they uſed to go for Recreation) to refreſh himſelf; This pleaſed him well, and ſeveral Companies of ſuperfluous Souldiers were disbanded, no man grumbling at any thing he did; which made him grow proud, and multiplicity of Buſineſſes and want of ſleep diſtempering his Brain, he gave forth many cruel Edicts for burning of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63178:73"/>
chopping off heads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereupon ſome of his Captains complained to the Archbiſhop that he grew intolerable, impriſoning, and commanding their Heads to be cut off to pleaſe his Humor; The Arch-Biſhop laboured to moderate and mollifie him, at leaſt to procure his deferring the Execution for that holy day, which he obtained; That afternoon <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanello</hi> went with a multitude of People following him to the Caſtle in an odd habit, deſiring the Vice-Roy to go with him to that Iſland to take the freſh Air, but he excuſed it by reaſon of a pain in his head, yet commanded his <hi>Gondola</hi> to be made ready to wait upon Seignior <hi>Maſſanello,</hi> into which he embarqued himſelf with divers Mariners, and had forty Barges of Muſicians to make him Merry; and as he ſailed along he threw peices of Gold into the Sea, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners dived to fetch up again for his Paſtime, and all the afternoon he ſpent in Mirth, Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too freely of the Wine called <hi>Lachrymae Chriſti;</hi> and when he returned in the Evening, he gave all them that attended him 1O Meaſures of Wheat apiece. The ſame afternoon, <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s Wife, Mother and Siſter, clad in Cloth of Silver, with Chains of Gold, and other Rich Jewels, went in a ſtately Coach va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at eight Thouſand Crowns to give the Vice-Queen a Viſit, attended with divers other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, and when ſhe came to the Palace, Sedans were ſent for her and her Company, with a Guard of Halberdiers, Pages, and Lacquies to attend them; The Vice-Queen preſented her with a rich Diamond giving her great welcome, and many Dainties, and ſo returned, where they found <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſo heated with his Wine that he ſcarce knew what he ſaid or did, and thus ended Sunday.</p>
            <p>On Monday Morning he would have reſigned his Power, but his Wife and Kindred diſſwaded him, and himſelf conceived, that if he ſhould do it, he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other but death, but now when he came to manage his Authority, he committed ſo many Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63178:73"/>
and Tyrannical Acts, as made him hated by thoſe who before had adored him, and the reaſon of his diſtempered Brain was conceived to be from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal drink given him by the Vice-Roy the day before; To which may be added, want of Food and Sleep, for he was ſeldom at leaſure to do either, in regard of multiplicity of buſineſs which wholly took him up, Early that morning he rode into the Market-place with a naked Sword in his hand, ſtriking many, for no cauſe offered; A Captain who came to him about buſineſs he wounded in the Face; and meeting with one that was ſaid to be a Spy, he cauſed his head pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to be chopped off: another complaining, that his Wife was gone away with another man, he cauſed the Woman to be hanged, and the Man to be broken on the wheel. Then going to the Kings Stables, he took for himſelf and his Followers ſix of the beſt Horſes, but before he had gone far, better bethinking himſelf, he ſent them all back again. The Vice-Roy himſelf hearing of ſuch Extravagancies trembled, and retired into the inner Palace, cauſing it to be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and increaſed his Guard; Then <hi>Maſſanello</hi> ſent to two Noblemen to come to him into the Market-place, upon pain of burning their Palaces, if diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who returned anſwer, <hi>That they would wait on him;</hi> But inſtead thereof, having ſecured their Goods, they went to the Vice-Roy to complain of their Slaviſh Condition, and whilſt they were conſidering how to remedy it, there came two of his chief Friends and Counſellors making the ſame Complaint, ſaying, <hi>That they were in continual danger of their Lives, and that the People began to hate</hi> Maſſanello <hi>for his extream Cruelty;</hi> whereupon it was concluded, <hi>That the People ſhould be perſwaded to make their Addreſſes to the Vice-Roy, and therein to declare that they would have no more dependance upon him, but upon his Excellency only, provided that they might be aſſured to enjoy their Priviledges lately confirmed by Oath;</hi> This the Vice-Roy willingly aſſented to, and the People were perſwaded to accept of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63178:74"/>
and <hi>Maſſanello</hi> being gone abroad to take his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, many of them met with the Vice-Roy, where it was concluded, <hi>That</hi> Maſſanello <hi>ſhould be laid hold on, and kept in chains during his life, but not put to death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the good he had done for the People;</hi> At <hi>Maſſanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>'s return, being extreamly inflamed with Wine, he began to play many mad Pranks; whereupon the Captains of the People apprehended him, and put him in Cuſtody under a Guard of Souldiers, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple confederating with the Vice-Roy haſtened his End.</p>
            <p>Tueſday <hi>July</hi> 16, in the Morning <hi>Maſſanello</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary meeting ſome Bands of men going towards the Caſtle, proudly asked them, <hi>By whoſe Authority they Acted,</hi> One of the Captains anſwered, <hi>By the Authority of the Vice-Roy; Well,</hi> ſaid the Secretary, <hi>thy head ſhall pay for this;</hi> whereupon the Captain wounded him with his Sword, and another ſhot him through, and ſo they put him into a Sepulchre, But the people that adhered to the Vice-Roy drew him out, cut off his head, and dragged his body about the Streets; Preſently after, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> eſcaping out of Priſon, went to the Church of the Virgin of <hi>Carmine,</hi> and the Archbiſhop coming to ſing Maſs there, it being a great Feſtival day to that Saint, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> met him, ſaying, <hi>Moſt Eminent Lord I perceive that the People will now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, and go about to take away my life, I deſire that a Solemn Proceſſion may be made to this moſt holy Lady, for being to die, I ſhall then die with greater content;</hi> The Church being full of People, <hi>Maſſanello</hi> went to the Altar, and taking a Crucifix in his hand, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, himſelf to the People, remembring then what great things he had done for them; the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he had encountered with, and the hatred that he had procured to himſelf thereby, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then proſtrating himſelf at the Archbiſhops Feet, he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to ſend the Vice-Roy word, <hi>That he would willingly renounce his Command, and reſign it into his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies hand;</hi> which the Archbiſhop promiſed him to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63178:74"/>

fiercely at them, but was beſet and taken; the Nails of his Hands and Feet bowed inward, he ſpake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but ſent out an inarticulate ſound, they brought him thence to a Gentlemans Houſe not far off, where they put Iron Manacles upon his Hands and Feet; in the end by being long kept Faſting, they had brought him to a Tameneſs, and in ſeven months had taught him to ſpeak; He was afterward by Circumſtance of time, and ſix Fingers he had on one hand, known to be the Child of a Woman, who ſtealing Wood was purſued by the Officers, and in her fright left her Chile then about nine Months old, which as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was carried away by the She-wolf aforeſaid, and by her nouriſhed to the time of his taking.

Remains) ſeek Innovation by Faction; Diſcontent is the great Seducer which at firſt put him to ſearch into a Plot he afterward was betrayed into; The cheif In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of this Medley were two Popiſh Prieſts, <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> and Count <hi>Aremberg</hi> Ambaſſador Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary from the Arch-duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who brought in the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and he his brother <hi>George Brook,</hi> both ſeeming Proteſtants; <hi>Brook</hi> drew in Sir <hi>Edward Parham</hi> and others, and they the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> a zealous Puritan; then came in Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> the wiſeſt of them all (ſays Mr. <hi>Sanderſon</hi>) who dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, ſays he, like a fly in the Flame till it conſumed him, Willing he was to know the Deſign, and thought by his Wit to over-reach the Confederates, whom he knew well enough, though he dealt with none but <hi>Cobham;</hi> One Mr. <hi>Laurency</hi> an <hi>Antwerp</hi> Merchant was made uſe of by Count <hi>Aremberg,</hi> and was an intimate of the Lord <hi>Cobham's,</hi> theſe ſays <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> carried on the contrivance a great while, which at laſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by <hi>Laurency,</hi> and the Vigilancy of the Lord <hi>Cecil.</hi> And indeed it was morally impoſſible that ſo many diſagreeing weak Souls ſhould carry on a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without taking Air, the leaſt glimpſe being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to give Light to the Stateſmen of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>The Deſign they were charged with was, 1. <hi>To ſet the Crown on the head of the Lady</hi> Arabella Stewart, <hi>or to ſeize the King, and make him grant their deſires, or a Pardon;</hi> and that Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> ſhould ſay to <hi>Brook, It will never be well in</hi> England <hi>till the King and his Cubs be taken away.</hi> 2. <hi>To have a Toleration of Religion.</hi> 3. <hi>To procure Aid and Aſſiſtance, from Forreign Princes.</hi> 4. <hi>To turn out of the Court ſuch as they diſliked, and place themſelves in Offices.</hi> Watſon <hi>to be Lord Chancellor,</hi> George Brook <hi>Lord Treaſurer, Sir</hi> Griffin Markham <hi>Secretary of State;</hi> Lord Grey <hi>to be Maſter of the Horſe, and Earl Marſhal of</hi> England; But it ſeems they made no Proviſion for <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> which is no inconſiderable Argument of his Innocency, who could have deſerved, and might

have expected as great a reward as any of them had he been engaged in the <hi>Plot;</hi> To oblige to Secrecy, <hi>Watſon</hi> draws up an Oath; But all is betrayed, they are Seized, Examined and Tryed at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Nov. 17. 1603. and the Lord <hi>Cobham, George Brook,</hi> his Brother, <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilton,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> Sir <hi>Griffith Markham,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Parham</hi> Knights, <hi>Bartholomew Brooksby,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Copley</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, <hi>W.

Therefore he is confined to the Tower, where he writ that excellent <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the only fault or defect rather is, that it wanteth one half thereof, which was occaſioned as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly related, thus; Some few days before he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſent for Mr. <hi>Walter Burr,</hi> who formerly printed his firſt Volume of the <hi>Hiſtory of the World,</hi> and asking him how it ſold, Mr. <hi>Burr</hi> anſwered, <hi>It ſold ſo ſlowly that it had undone him;</hi> At which words Sir <hi>Walter</hi> ſtepping to his Desk, reaches his other unprinted part of his Hiſtory, which he had brought down to the times he lived in, and clapping his hand upon his breaſt ſaid with a ſigh; <hi>Ah my friend, hath the firſt part undone thee, the ſecond Part ſhall undo no more; this ungrateful World is unworthy of it;</hi> and immediately going to the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide threw it in, and ſet his Foot upon it till it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; As great a loſs to Learning as <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> could have ſuſtained, and the greater becauſe it could be repaired by no hand but his.</p>
            <p>While Sir <hi>Walter was thus confined,</hi> Death took away his Mortal Enemy Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> after Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> who had purchaſed the Monopoly of Favour,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63178:86"/>
and being jealous of Sir <hi>Walters</hi> Abilities, had ſome fear he might ſupplant him, which was the cauſe, ſays <hi>Osborn,</hi> that he was brought to the aforementioned Trial; However Sir <hi>Walter</hi> outlived his Deſigns and Hatred, and for all kindneſſes beſtowed on him the following Epitaph, which is certainly affirmed to be his; King <hi>James</hi> was ſo taken with the ſmartneſs of them, that he hoped the Author would dye before him; The Verſes are theſe,

            <p>When Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was arrived at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> Sir <hi>Lewes Steukly</hi> ſeized him, and was ordered by the King to bring him to <hi>London,</hi> which could add no Terror to a Perſon who could expect nothing leſs; and was now forced to uſe all the Arts imaginable to appeaſe Hls Majeſty and defer his Anger; To which intent <hi>Manow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Quack at <hi>Salisbury</hi> gave him ſeveral Vomits, and an Artificial Compoſition, which made him look Gaſtly and Dreadful, full of Pimples and Bliſters, and deceiv'd even the Phyſitians themſelves, who could not tell what to make of his Urine (though often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected) it being adulterated with a Drug in the Glaſs that turned it even in their hands into an earthy humor of a blackiſh colour and of a very Offenſive Savour; while he lay under this Politick diſguize, he penned his Dedication and Apology aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, when he was brought to <hi>London,</hi> he was confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to his own houſe, but finding the Court whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guided by <hi>Gundamore,</hi> he could hope for little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore he deſigned to eſcape into <hi>France,</hi> which Sir <hi>Lewes Steukly</hi> betrayed; but the Fate of Traytors purſued him and brought him to a Contemptible end, to dye a poor diſtracted Beggar in the Iſle of <hi>Lindey,</hi> having for a Bag of Money falſified his Faith, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tye of the Holy Sacrament (as Mr. <hi>Howel</hi> relates) and alſo before the year came about was found clipping the ſame very Coin (in the Kings own Palace at <hi>Whitehal</hi>) which he had received for a reward of his Perfidiouſneſs; for which being condemned to be hang'd, he was forced to ſell himſelf to his Shirt to purchaſe his Pardon of two Knights.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Yet it has been much wondred at, how that old ſentence which had lain dormant 16 years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, againſt Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> could be now made uſe of to take off his head afterward; Conſidering that the then Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> told him poſitively; (as Sir <hi>Walter</hi> was acquainting him that he could procure his pardon for a leſs ſum of money, then his <hi>Guiana</hi> preparations amounted to) <hi>Sir</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Knee-tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your Voyage is money, ſpare your Purſe in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, for upon my life you have a ſufficient pardon for all that is paſſed already, the King having under his</hi> Broad-Seal made you Admiral of <hi>your Fleet, and given you power of Martial Law, over the Officers and Souldiers;</hi> It was then likewiſe the opinion of many Lawyers, that he who by His Majeſties Patent had power of Life and Death over the Kings Leige People, ſhould be eſteemed or Judged <hi>Rectus in curia,</hi> and free from all Old Convictions.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday <hi>October</hi> 29. 1618.

directing himſelf toward a Window where the Lords <hi>Arundel, Doncaſter,</hi> and other Lords and Knights ſate, he with a loud voice ſpake as followeth; <q>I thank God of his infinite goodneſs that he hath ſent me to dye in the ſight of ſo honourable an Aſſembly, and not in darkneſs;</q> But by reaſon the place where they ſate was ſome diſtance from the Scaffold, that they could not eaſily hear him, he ſaid; <q>I will ſtrain my ſelf, for I would willingly have your Honours hear me; The Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> anſwered, we will come upon the Scaffold;</q> where after he had ſaluted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them ſeverally, he proceeded as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Honourable Lords, and the reſt of my good Friends who come to ſee me dye; I thank my God heartily, that he hath brought me into the light to dye, and not ſuffered me to dye in the dark Priſon of the Tower, where I have ſuffered a great deal of Adverſity, and a long ſickneſs, and I thank God that my Feaver hath not taken me at this time, as I prayed God it might not; There are two main points of ſuſpition that his Majeſty hath conceived againſt me, wherein he cannot be ſatisfied, which I deſire to clear, and reſolve you in; Firſt, That I had a Plot with <hi>France,</hi> His Majeſty had ſome cauſe, though grounded upon a weak Foundation, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect mine inclination to the <hi>French Faction,</hi> for not long before my departure from <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Agent took occaſion paſſing by my houſe to viſit me, and had ſome conference during the time of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad, only concerning my Voyage, and nothing elſe, I take God to witneſs; Though it was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I had a Commiſſion from the King of <hi>France;</hi> But this I ſay, for a man to call God to witneſs to a falſhood at any time is a grievous ſin, and what ſhall he hope for at the Tribunal of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But to call God to witneſs to a falſhood at the time of death, is far more grievous and impious, and there is no hope for ſuch a one; And what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63178:89"/>
ſhould I expect that am now going to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Faith, I do therefore call the Lord to witneſs, as I hope to be ſaved, and as I hope to ſee him in his Kingdom, which will be within a quarter of an hour, I never had any Commiſſion from the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor any Treaty with the <hi>French</hi> Agent, nor with any other from the <hi>French</hi> King, neither knew I that there was an Agent, nor what he was, till I met him in my Gallery at my lodging, unlookt for; If I ſpeak not true, O Lord let me not come into thy Kingdom; I cannot deny that when I came back from <hi>Guiana,</hi> being come to <hi>Plymouth</hi> I endeavoured to go to <hi>Rochel,</hi> which was, becauſe I would fain have made my Peace before I came to <hi>England,</hi> having heard a rumor, that there was no hope of my life upon my return to <hi>London,</hi> I would have eſcaped for the ſafe-guard of my life, and not for any ill intent, or conſpiracy againſt the State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The ſecond ſuſpition was, that his Majeſty hath been informed I ſhould ſpeak diſhonourably and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyally of him, there is no witneſs againſt me but only one Mimical <hi>Frenchman,</hi> whom I entertained rather for his Jeſts than his Judgment; His way was to incroach himſelf into the favour of the Lords, and gaping after ſome great reward, hath falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me of ſeditious ſpeeches againſt His Majeſty, againſt whom if I did either ſpeak or think a thought hurtful or prejudicial, the Lord blot me out of the Book of Life. But in this now what have I to do with Kings? I have nothing to do with them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I fear them; I have now to do with God, therefore to tell a Lye now, to get the favour of the King were in vain; It is not a time to flatter nor fear Princes, for I am ſubject to none but <hi>death,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have a charitable opinion of me, and think me not now raſhly or untruly to confirm or proteſt any thing.</q>

from <hi>London to France,</hi> but my anſwer to this is as to the other, that only for my ſafeguard, and nothing elſe was my intent, as I ſhall anſwer before the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; It is alledged that I feigned my ſelf ſick, and by Art made my body full of bliſters at <hi>Salisbury;</hi> True it is, I did ſo, the reaſon was, becauſe I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped thereby to defer my coming before the King and Council, and ſo by delaying might have got time to have gained my pardon; I have an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of Scripture for my Warrant; The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> in caſe of neceſſity, and for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of his life, feigned himſelf fooliſh and mad, yet it was not imputed to him for ſin. As for other Objections, that I was brought by force into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that I carried Sixteen Thouſand Pounds in money out of <hi>England</hi> with me, more than I made known; That I ſhould recieve Letters from the French King, and ſuch like;</q> He with many Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations utterly denyed it; Concluding thus, <q>And now I intreat you all to join with me in Prayer, that the great God of Heaven whom I have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended, being a man full of all vanity, and have lived a ſinful life in all ſinful callings, having been a Souldier, a Captain, a Sea Captain, and a Courtier, which are all places of wickedneſs and vice; That God I ſay would forgive me, and caſt away my ſins from me, and that he would recieve me into Everlaſting Life, and ſo I take my leave of you all, making my peace with God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then Proclamation being made that all men ſhould depart the Scaffold, he prepared himſelf for death, giving away his hat, and wrought night-cap, and ſome money to ſuch as he knew that ſtood near him, taking his leave of the Lords, Knights, and other Gentlemen, and thanking the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> for his Company, intreating him to deſire the King, <hi>That no ſcandalous Writing to defame him might be publiſhed after his death;</hi> adding, <hi>I have a long Journey to go, and therefore will take my leave;</hi> Then putting off his Gown
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63178:90"/>
and Doublet, he called to the Headſman to ſhew him the Axe, which being not preſently done, he ſaid, <hi>Prithee let me ſee it, doſt thou think that I am afraid of it,</hi> and having it in his hands, he felt along upon the edg of it, and ſmiling, ſpake to the Sheriff, ſaying, <hi>This is a ſharp Medicine, but it is a Phyſician for all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes;</hi> Then going to and fro upon the Scaffold on every ſide, he prayed the company to pray to God to aſſiſt, and ſtrengthen him; Being asked on which ſide of the block he would lay himſelf, he replyed, <hi>So the heart be right, it is no matter which way the head lyeth,</hi> and then praying, after he had forgiven the Executioner, having given him a ſign when he ſhould do his Office, at two blows he loſt both head and life, his body never ſhrinking nor moving; His Head was ſhewn on each ſide the Scaffold, and then put into a Red Leather Bag, and his wrought Velvet Gown thrown over it; which was afterward convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away in a mourning Coach of his Ladies; The large effuſion of blood which proceeded from his Loins amazed the Spectators, who judged that he had a ſtock of nature ſufficient to have lived much longer, though now near 80 years old. He behaved himſelf at his death with ſo high, and ſo Religious a reſolution, as if a Chriſtian had acted a <hi>Roman,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Roman</hi> a Chriſtian, and by the Magnanimity which was then conſpicuous in him, he abundantly bafled their Calumnies who had accuſed him of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.

The Adventures and Dangers of Mr. <hi>John Watts</hi> are no leſs remarkable than any yet mentioned, which are related by himſelf, as followeth, This <hi>John Watts</hi> being about 18 years of Age, ſhipt himſelf at <hi>Deal</hi> in the <hi>Peachtree</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> of about 60 Tun in <hi>June</hi> 1668; The Ship had not been long in the <hi>Downes</hi> but a fair Gale preſenting, they hoiſted Sail; The firſt place they touched at was the <hi>Gold Coaſt,</hi> and from thence they went to <hi>Old Calabar,</hi> in the <hi>Bith</hi> of <hi>Guinney;</hi> They entred a River called <hi>Croſs</hi> River into <hi>Pirates Iſland;</hi> After they had taken in their <hi>Negroes</hi> and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Sail, the Maſter calls up the Boatſwain and three men more, whereof <hi>Watts</hi> was one, and commands them to look out the Copper Bars that were left, and carry them on ſhore to try if they could ſell them; The Boatſwain with his ſmall Company deſired that they might have Arms with them, not believing the common Report, that they were an harmleſs, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People; They took with them three Muskets and a Piſtol, and ſo rowed toward the ſhore, but not
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63178:100"/>
far from it, our Match fell unhappily into the Water, and our ſhip being fallen down from that narrow part of the River nearer the Sea, quite out of our ſight, we were conſulting what would be ſafeſt for us to do, we were not willing voluntarily to deſtroy our ſelves, and were aſhamed to return to our Ship before we had diſpatched our buſineſs; At length the Boatſwain ſent the Relator <hi>John Wats</hi> on ſhore to the firſt houſe to light our Match, that we had recovered out of the Water after it was extinct, which he readily obeyed; But before he was twenty Rods from the Waterſide, he was ſeized on by two Blacks, or rather <hi>Tawny Moors,</hi> and by them haled above half a mile up into the Countrey, and thrown with great violence upon his Belly, and ſo compelled to lye till they ſtript him, and more Company coming to them, they were ſo eager for his poor Canvas Apparel, that ſome they tore off, others they cut off, and with that ſeveral pieces of his Fleſh, to his Intolerable pain; with theſe rags they made little Childrens Aprons to cover their Privities, Linnen and Woollen being very ſcarce there.</p>
            <p>The Boatſwain ſeeing <hi>John Wats</hi> thus carried away, was reſolved with his two Companions to have him again, with the venture of their Lives; They Arm themſelves; but whilſt they were conſulting whether to venture on ſhore or not; of a ſudden they were beſet with about a Dozen men in ſeveral Canoes, but they valiantly maintained their Boat for three hours, for after two or three Muſquets were diſcharged they defended themſelves with the Oars and Boathooks; The Boatſwain received a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat; the other two adventured into the River, endeavouring by ſwiming to eſcape the mercileſs hands of Cruel Infidels; But the <hi>Negroes</hi> with their ſwift Canoes ſoon overtook them, and brought them on ſhore to the place where <hi>John Wats</hi> was; The <hi>Negroes</hi> took the Boatſwain out of the Ships Boat, and inſtead of endeavouring to preſerve
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63178:101"/>
his life, they preſently cut off his head with a ſharp weapon before his Companions Faces; and whilſt he was yet reeking in his Bloud, they barbarouſly cut off peices of Fleſh from his Buttocks, Thighs, Arms, and Shoulders, and broiling it on the Coals, they with great impatience, eagerly eat it before our faces as a moſt rare Banquet, to our great terror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; About fourteen days after, one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany fell ſick, but inſtead of being Phyſitians to cure him, they were his Butchers to murther him; They ſerved him as they did the Boatſwain, cut off his head, and broiled and eat up his fleſh, and rejoyced ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly at this pleaſant Entertainment; Ten days after the third fell ſick, whom they uſed in the ſame manner; Theſe dreadful Executions much affected <hi>John Wats,</hi> who expected hourly to taſte of the ſame Cruelty, but through Divine providence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Alteration of the Climate, want of Clothes, and the ſtrangeneſs of the Food which was only Herbs, he continued in good health, and the Natives who daily expected another Banquet were diſappointed, either their Cuſtoms, or the overruling power of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven not ſuffering them to deſtroy him while he was well.</p>
            <p>His Maſter therefore reſolved to ſell him, with whom he was pretty free to diſcourſe, <hi>Wats</hi> having about three years before been in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he had learned the <hi>Tata</hi> Language, which is eaſily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, being comprehended in a very few words, and all the <hi>Negroes</hi> ſpeak it; He deſired to know of his Maſter the reaſon of their Cruelty, who bid him be ſatisfied, ſince unleſs he were ſick he ſhould not have his head cut off. In the Boat with which they went firſt aſhore one Muſquet of the three was ſaved, and had not been diſcharged, which his Maſter brought to him to teach him the uſe of it, which for fear of his Maſters diſpleaſure and their inhumanity he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do, but they ſtill profeſſing their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, he was forced to ſhoot it off; But the <hi>Negroes</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:63178:101"/>
who expected ſome delightful thing, being fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and at the ſudden noiſe and flaſh of fire, which they very much dread, fled from him greatly affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet ſoon after, hearing no more of that noiſe, they came up to him again, commanding him to do the like; He told them, he had not Powder which was the cauſe of the noiſe, but this would not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie theſe <hi>Barbarians;</hi> and therefore thinking it wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they would have murthered him, had not his Maſter reſcued him; After this, in diſcourſe with his Maſter, he told him, <hi>That naturally the people were civil, and ſimply honeſt, but if provoked, full of revenge; and that this their barbarous dealing was occaſioned by ſome unhandſome action, of carrying a Native away from thence without their leave about a year before, they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if any came on ſhore, they ſhould never go off alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About 7 weeks after <hi>Wats</hi> had been in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his Maſter preſented him to his King, named <hi>Efnme</hi> King of the <hi>Buckamores,</hi> who immediately gave him to his Daughter, called <hi>Onijah;</hi> when the King went abroad, he attended him as his Page, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above 12 Miles, yet he boaſted extreamly of his Power and Strength, glorying exceedingly that he had a <hi>White Man</hi> to attend him, whom he imployed to carry his Bow and Arrows; In ſeveral places far from the Seaſide, the people would run away from him for fear, others would fall down, and ſeem to worſhip him, uſing thoſe Actions as they do to their Gods; Their progreſs was never ſo long, but they could return home at night, but never without a handſome load of a cup of the Creature; for he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never went abroad, and came home ſober; Their drink is of the beſt <hi>Palm</hi> Wine, and another ſort of ſtrong Liquor called <hi>Penrore; Wats</hi> knew quickly how to humour this profound Prince, and if any of the Natives abuſed him, upon his complaint he had Redreſs, as once by ſtriving with a <hi>Negro,</hi> his Arm was broke, which by Providence more than
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63178:102"/>
skill was ſet again. After ſome Months, the King of <hi>Calamanch,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Eſn mancha,</hi> hearing of this beautiful <hi>White,</hi> Courted his Neighbour Prince to ſell him to him; at length they ſtruck a bargain, and <hi>Wats</hi> was ſold for a Cow, and a Goat.</p>
            <p>This King was a very ſober and moderate perſon, free from the treacheries and miſchiefs that the other was ſubject to; He would often diſcourſe <hi>Wats,</hi> and ask him of his King and Country; whether his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Dominions were as big as his, which were not above 25 Miles in length, and 15 in breadth; <hi>Wats</hi> told him as much as his underſtanding and years made him capable of, keeping ſtill within the bounds of modeſty, and yet relating as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the Honour and Dignity of his Soveraign; Firſt informing him of the greatneſs of one of his Kingdomes, the ſeveral Shires and Counties it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Caſtles, the ſtrength of each, the infinite Inhabitants and valour of his Subjects; One of theſe Kingdoms was enough ſufficiently to amaze this Petty Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he had no need to mention any more of His Majeſties Glory and Dignity; It put him into ſuch a profound Conſternation, that he reſolved to find out ſome way to ſhew his reſpects to this Mighty Prince, and told <hi>John Wats, that if he could find but a Paſſage, he would let him go to</hi> England, <hi>to tell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty of the great favour and reſpect he had for him;</hi> Which did not a little rejoyce our <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the King told him; <hi>He would ſend him a preſent which ſhould be two Cabareets or Goats,</hi> which they value very highly, the King himſelf having not above 16 or 18 of them; <hi>Wats</hi> tells the King, <hi>that the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>had many Thouſands of his Subjects who were under the degree of Gentlemen, that had a Thouſand Sheep apeice, the Fleſh whereof they valued at a very much higher rate than Goats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though our <hi>Engliſhman</hi> lived very handſomely with this King, yet his deſires and hopes were for his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63178:102"/>
Native Countrey, and at length he obtained a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from his King, <hi>That the firſt</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship which came into the Road, ſhould have liberty to releaſe or purchaſe him;</hi> This very much rejoyced his heart, and now he thought every day a year, till he could hear of, or ſee ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship arrive, and oft did he walk to the Sea ſide to receive ſome comfort; which at length was obſerved by <hi>Jaga</hi> a Wizard, and the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in 3 or 4 Kingdoms thereabout; They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that the Natives give very much credit to, and on any difficult occaſion run to them for ſatisfaction; And though they have vaſt numbers of them in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place, yet this <hi>Jaga</hi> was the moſt renowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them; One day he comes to <hi>Wats,</hi> and asked him very civilly, <hi>why he ſo often frequented that place,</hi> who told him; It was to ſee if he could diſcover any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship to come in there; But <hi>Wats</hi> being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his great fame, asked him, <hi>when he did believe there would one come in;</hi> Not that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give credit to any of their Divinations, but ſuppoſing hereby to pleaſe him, and anſwer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; <hi>Jaga</hi> immediately told him, <hi>That</hi> 15 <hi>days after an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ship ſhould come into that Road;</hi> He then askt him, <hi>whether that Ship ſhould carry him away;</hi> To which he anſwered very doubtfully, but told him, <hi>He ſhould be offered to the Maſter of the Ship, and if they did not agree, ſo that he were brought to ſhore again; he ſhould not be ſold, but would dye for grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe 15 days ſeemed very tedious to <hi>Wats,</hi> who caſt many a look on the Sea with an aking heart; The 14th. day he went to the higheſt Hill therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, but could diſcover no Ship; the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he went again 2 or 3 times, but ſaw none; About 2 or 3 hours after, ſome <hi>Moors</hi> came running, and told the King there was a <hi>Canoe</hi> coming, for ſo they called our Ships; At which our <hi>Engliſhman</hi> rejoyced heartily, in hope of releaſe, yet durſt not ſhew it for fear of Puniſhment or Death, for though he lived better now than with his firſt Maſter, yet his ſervice
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63178:103"/>
was far worſe than the ſlaves in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et worſe than Dogs meat; he had therefore cauſe enough of inward joy; The Ship came immediately in; and <hi>Wats</hi> goes preſently to <hi>Jaga,</hi> to know if it were an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, who aſſured him it was; It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be the St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s Merchant, Captain <hi>Royden</hi> Commander, who haſtned to diſpatch his buſineſs, took in his <hi>Negroes,</hi> and was ready to ſail, and our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman</hi> heard not a word what ſhould become of him, the King never offering to ſell him; This made him reſolve on an eſcape, to which end he had prepared a piece of Timber near the waterſide, on which he intended to paddle to the Ship, which then lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a League from the Shore; Juſt as he was about to lanch his little floating board, he eſpied a great <hi>Aligator,</hi> which will devour a man at a mouthful; This made him alter his reſolution, and reſolve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to live with inhumane Infidels, than to throw himſelf into ſo imminent a danger; The next day God Almighty opened the heart of the King to let the poor <hi>Engliſhman</hi> go; He ſent him in a <hi>Canoe</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betwixt a <hi>Negro</hi>'s Legs, with ſome others to guide this ſmall Veſſel, for fear he ſhould leap overboard, and ſwim to the Ship.</p>
            <p>At a diſtance from the Ship he haled her in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, which made thoſe aboard much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire; The <hi>Negroes</hi> gave him leave to ſtand up, and ſhew himſelf to the Captain, to whom he gave an account how four were left there, and he only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; It was ſome time before they could bargain, though the Captain was reſolved not to leave him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; Several times the <hi>Negroes</hi> padled away with their Canoe, reſolving not to part with him, but with promiſes and intreaties he perſwaded them back to the Ship again, and they delivered him on board for 45 Copper and Iron Bars, the Copper being as big as a Youths little Finger, and the Iron ſomewhat bigger, now were his Joys compleated, he could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf but it was a Dream or Viſion, and that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63178:103"/>
he did not really ſee <hi>Engliſh</hi> faces again, nor imbrace <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bodies; It was ſome time before he could throw himſelf at the Captains feet, to acknowledge his infinite obligations to him; When he came on board, his Hair was very long, and his Skin tawny, having gone naked all the time he was there, and frequently anointing himſelf with <hi>Palm</hi> Oyl, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like a Tawny <hi>Moor;</hi> But the Seamen aboard, with Chriſtian Hearts ſoon apparelled him; The Maſter hoiſted Sail for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> where he was to ſtay ſome time, but <hi>Wats</hi> earneſtly deſiring to ſee his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, got paſſage in the <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and by the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, in a few Weeks ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived in the <hi>Downes,</hi> and was entertained by his Uncle, Mr. <hi>Richard Wats</hi> of <hi>Deal</hi> with great joy, who took this Relation from his own mouth. <hi>Sea Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</hi> Pag. 73.</p>
            <p n="103">103. The unparalleld revolution in <hi>Portugal</hi> in the year 1641, is very worthy to be remembred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> loſt that whole Kingdom as it were in one day; with almoſt all the Iſlands, Forts and Provinces, thereunto belonging. To give a particular account of this great Tranſaction, it will be neceſſary to look a little back upon the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſes, and occaſion thereof;</p>
            <p>In the Year 1573. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> Grandchild of King <hi>John</hi> the 3d. and Sixteenth King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Kingdom, being about 23 years old; Scarce was he well ſetled in his Throne, having Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not above a year an half, but Ambaſſadors from <hi>Muly Mahamet,</hi> then turned out of his Kingdoms of <hi>Feſſe</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> by his Uncle <hi>Abdemelech,</hi> implored his Aid in the recovery of his Kingdom, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That if he would aſſiſt him to drive out</hi> Abdeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech, <hi>he would freely reſign to</hi> Sebaſtian, <hi>the Kingdom of</hi> Morocco, <hi>and content himſelf with that of</hi> Feſſe. Ambition of Glory and Dominion, makes <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> readily undertake the Enterprize, ſending to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> for Aſſiſtance, who promiſes him Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63178:104"/>
men, but ſailed, yet with the Forces that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had levied, he reſolves couragiouſly to proceed; To which by accident, juſt as he was going, he got ſome addition; For <hi>Stukely</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> as he was going with a ſmall Fleet of Ships, and about Six Thouſand <hi>Italian</hi> Souldiers to aſſiſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels againſt Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> was by Tempeſt driven into <hi>Lisbon;</hi> Whom King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> with much intreaty, perſwades to deſiſt from his intended deſign, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him into <hi>Barbary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ſet forth, he arrives at <hi>Tangier</hi> with an Army of about Thirty Thouſand men, where he meets <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mahamet</hi> with a very ſmall addition of Forces, and much leſs than he expected, yet he marches forward toward <hi>Abdemelech,</hi> who by Letters in vain, adviſed him to return in Peace; The 2 Armies meet in the Plains of <hi>Alcazar,</hi> where King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, himſelf, <hi>Muly Mahamet, Stukely,</hi> and ſeveral perſons of quality ſlain; Three Kings fell in this field, for <hi>Abdemelech</hi> was ſlain in the hotteſt of the fight; This Battel was fought in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1578, yet ſome have affirmed that <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was not ſlain in this Battel, but that for ſhame and ſorrow he returned not home, but wandring from one place to another, was at laſt diſcovered at <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence by command of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was carryed to <hi>Naples,</hi> where he was kept three dayes in a dark and diſmal Dungeon, without any ſuſtenance, but a Knife and an Halter, where he miſerably dyed. Whether this were the true <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> or not, was not certainly known, but he was ſo like him, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> uſed to ſay, <hi>if it were not he, it was the Devil in his likeneſs;</hi> But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he being thus loſt to the <hi>Portugals, Henry</hi> the Cardinal (third Son to <hi>Emanual</hi> the firſt, who was Grandfather to <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi>) ſucceeded in the Kingdom, but he being both by reaſon of his Age, which was 67 years, and his Function, being a Churchman, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all means to give the people any hope of Iſſue, it was the whole diſcourſe not only of <hi>Portugal;</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:63178:104"/>
but all Chriſtendom, during the ſhort time of his Reign, who of right ought, and who probably might ſucceed King <hi>Henry</hi> in the Kingdom; There were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pretenders thereunto, but <hi>Catherine</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> and youngeſt Daughter to Don <hi>Edward,</hi> ſixth Son of <hi>Emanual</hi> aforementioned, had the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and undoubted Right; yet <hi>Philip</hi> 2. King of <hi>Spain</hi> likewiſe made his claim, though contrary to the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, which <hi>Philip</hi> knew very well; but having Power and Might on his ſide, he little regarded Rights and Titles, thinking them not ſtrong enough againſt the infallible Arguments of Souldiers, Arms and Money; and therefore no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did the News of the death of King <hi>Henry</hi> arrive at the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court, but the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded with an Army of Twenty Thouſand men to march to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and in the name and right of his Catholick Majeſty, to make conqueſt of that Kingdom if he found oppoſition.</p>
            <p>But little reſiſtance was made, only <hi>Don Antonio</hi> the Baſtard, ſon of <hi>Lewes</hi> the <hi>Infante,</hi> having got into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in the head of a Tumultuary Rabble, rather than a well formed Army, endeavoured at firſt to make ſome defence, but was ſoon defeated, and the Suburbs of <hi>Lisbon</hi> being plundered to ſatisfie the Souldiers, the City was ſurrendred to him; Whither ſoon after King <hi>Philip</hi> came, and ſo by a mixt Title of Deſcent and Arms, took poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in 1580. <hi>Katherine</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inforced to ſurrender to him all her Intereſt and Pretenſions to that Crown; The Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Portugal</hi> were without doubt extreamly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized, and made ſubject to a Forreign Prince, and eſpecially to a Prince of that Nation againſt whom they had a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural hatred and antipathy, but finding themſelves in a condition not able to make reſiſtance, they thought they ſhould gain more by freely ſubmitting to the King, than to be forced to it; They therefore
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63178:105"/>
made their humble ſubmiſſion, which King <hi>Philip</hi> met as it were half way, and condeſcended in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or General Aſſembly of Eſtates, of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to be ſworn to theſe Articles or Capitulations following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſaid</hi> Philip <hi>King of</hi> Spain, <hi>&amp;c.

them but the leaſt opportunity; For that the People were highly diſcontented, it did eaſily appear by their Attentive liſtening after Old Prophecies, among which was one of an Old Hermit, who told <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>Portugal</hi> of the great Victory he ſhould obtain over the five Kings of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and <hi>That his Poſterity ſhould reign happily Kings of</hi> Portugal, <hi>but that in the ſixteenth Generation, his Line ſhould fail, but that God at length ſhould have mercy again upon them, and reſtore them.</hi> Others had regard to a Letter written by St. <hi>Bernard</hi> to the ſame King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> (the Original of which is reported to have been given to the <hi>Portugal</hi> Ambaſſador by <hi>Lewis</hi> 13, King of <hi>France</hi> in 1641) the ſubſtance whereof was; <hi>That he rendred Thanks to him for the Lands beſtowed upon him, and that in recompence thereof, God had declared unto him, that there ſhould not fail a Native of</hi> Portugal <hi>to ſit upon the Throne, unleſs for the greatneſs of their Sins, God would chaſtiſe them for a time, but that this time of Chaſtiſement ſhould not laſt above threeſcore years;</hi> Other Propheſies there were of this Nature, and to this Effect, which put the People in hope of a Deliverance, and many flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that <hi>Don Sebaſtian</hi> was yet alive, and would come and deliver them; nay ſo fooliſh were ſome of them that though they believed him ſlain at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Alcazer</hi> in Barbary, yet they thought he ſhould live again, and miraculouſly come to Redeem them.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt of all expreſt the Peoples diſcontents, was what was publickly ſpoken by the Mouths of their Orators the Prieſts in their Pulpits, who would ordinarily in their Sermons utter Speeches much to the prejudice of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Title, and in Favour of the Dutcheſs of <hi>Braganza,</hi> nor did they ſpare to do ſo, even in the preſence of King <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, who would therefore often ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Portuguez <hi>Clergy had made the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt War with him;</hi> Father <hi>Lewes Alvarez</hi> a Jeſuit, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day before the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Vice-Roy took his

            <p>Yet did King <hi>Philip</hi> bear all theſe Affronts with an incomparable Patience, diſſembling with an Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prudence his Paſſion (if he had any) for theſe diſcontents; for he knew the only way to win this Nation to an Obedience and Compliance, muſt be mildneſs at firſt, whatever he intended to practice afterward, and that he had by his exact keeping his Word and Oath, won much upon this People appears, in that during his whole Reign, and that of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor King <hi>Philip</hi> the third, who followed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Footſteps, though not with that Craft and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, they made no Attempts, nor were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to revolt, only ſome ſmall buſtles with <hi>Antonio the Baſtard</hi> aforementioned, and one or two Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit <hi>Sebaſtians,</hi> not worth mentioning, for they, as was ſaid, keeping their words in moſt things, (though they infringed ſome of their Priviledges) had almoſt brought the People to a willing Slavery; But King <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth committing the whole charge of the Government to his Favourite Count <hi>Olivarez,</hi> who though without doubt an able Stateſman, yet would ſeem to have a way in Policy by himſelf, which no

body elſe could underſtand the reaſons of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by loſt this whole Kingdom and all its Territories; For ſuch were the new rigorous ways which he uſed in the Government of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> both Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple very tender of their Priviledges, the leaſt breach of which, ſhould have been ſeconded by a potent Force to have ſuppreſſed them, in caſe they ſhould attempt an Inſurrection; When inſtead of having ſuch Power in readineſs, the <hi>Catalonians</hi> had rather opportunity given them to Rebel, and ſpurs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them thereto; For ſome Souldiers being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringly quartered among them, but too few to curb them, they looked upon that as a greater Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon their Liberties than any before, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign utterly to inſlave them; wherefore converting their Patience into Fury, they took Arms, Maſſacred the Souldiers, ſlew their Vice-Roy, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the <hi>French</hi> Protection.</p>
            <p>This Revolt of the <hi>Catalonians</hi> was a Preſident to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who had extreamly ſuffered under the breach of their Priviledges, for contrary to the ſecond Article ſworn to by King <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond, <hi>That the Vice-Roy or Governour ſhould be either Son, Brother, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Nephew to the King of</hi> Spain; The Infanta <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garita di Mantoua</hi> who had no relation at all to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> was made Governeſs, which they might and perhaps would have born, had they not been incenſed by a more feeling injury in 1636, when a Tax of the fifth part of their Eſtates was impoſed upon all the Subjects of that Kingdom, an intolerable Greivance, and thought ſo inſufferable by the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts of the Nation, that they roſe in Arms to oppoſe it, and had ſet the whole Kingdom in a Flame if it had not been quenched by the timely care and Induſtry of the Governeſs. Yet this ſmall ſtir gave an <hi>Item</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of the readineſs of the People to Revolt, which made <hi>Olivarez</hi> endeavour by all ways to cut off the means of their being able to do it; and that was to allure thence <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:63178:107"/>
whom the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> looked upon as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who of <hi>Right</hi> ought to be their King, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Native of the Kingdom that might reſtore again the Line of <hi>Alphonſo;</hi> Beſides he was a Prince who for Power, Riches, and Number of Tenants, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceeded all the Nobles in <hi>Portugal,</hi> but even of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf; And indeed the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was one of the moſt Glorious Subjects in <hi>Europe,</hi> being allied to moſt Kings in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> which made the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> though they were Competitors for the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> Treat this Family with more Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our than any other of his Grandees, receiving them with almoſt as much reſpect as if they were Soveraign Princes, which appeared in King <hi>Philip</hi> 2. who moſt of all deſired to abaſe this Family, yet always when the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> came to viſit him, he would meet him in the middle of the Room, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to kiſs his hand, ſeat him with himſelf under the Canopy of Eſtate.</p>
            <p>To draw the Duke therefore out of <hi>Portugal, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varez</hi> firſt politickly offered him the Government of <hi>Millain,</hi> a place of great Truſt and Honour; but he modeſtly refuſed it, as not in a Condition at that preſent to undertake ſo great a Command, and indeed expreſſing an unwillingneſs to go out of the Kingdom, which made the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Count more willing to draw him from thence, and to this end it was diſcourſed; <hi>That the King himſelf was reſolved to go in Perſon to reduce the revolted</hi> Catalonians, <hi>and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Nobility ſhould be in readineſs in four months time to attend His Majeſty in that Expedition;</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> being ſuſpicious of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe he knew himſelf ſuſpected by them, and likely ſo to be, whilſt the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> ſo much affected him, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf of the ones love, and if poſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the others ſuſpition, retires himſelf to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Houſe at <hi>Villa Vicioſa,</hi> and there follows his ſports of Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not at all regarding matters of State, withal ſending an Excuſe to Count <hi>Olivarez, That his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63178:107"/>
Affairs were at preſent in ſo low and mean a Condition, that he could not appear to attend His Majeſty in that Pomp and Splendour which became a Perſon of his Quality, and that therefore he ſhould do His Majeſty more ſervice in ſtaying at home when the other Nobles were abroad, than he could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do by attending him;</hi> This Plot thus failing, made the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> more ſuſpicious of the Duke than ever before; Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> therefore reſolves to employ his utmoſt Art of Diſſimulation to intrap him, and that by ſuch means as in reaſon might make the Duke Ambitious of the Throne; though it appeared <hi>Olivarez</hi> truſted the Duke, only becauſe the Duke ſhould truſt him.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi>'s Letter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, The Count aſſures him, <hi>That His Majeſty was very well ſatisfied with the reaſons of his not attending him to</hi> Catalonia, <hi>being very ſenſible of his good inclinations to his ſervice That for his own part he was very ſorry his Affairs were in ſuch a low Condition, and could not but commiſerate his Intereſt as his own; That His Majeſty to let him know how great confidence he repoſed in his Fidelity, had appointed him General of the Militia of the Kingdom, and had for his preſent ſupply ſent him Threeſcore Thouſand Crowns, leaving it to his Choice to reſide in what place near</hi> Lisbon <hi>he pleaſed.</hi> This ſtrange Confidence repoſed in the Duke by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> much amazed the greateſt Politicians, who thought it reaſonable that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould have permitted the Duke ſtill to have kept retired in the Countrey, rather than to have given him ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and called him to <hi>Lisbon</hi> into the continual view of the People, who looking on him as the Heir of that Houſe, which had been ever repreſented to have the only Right to the Crown, might eaſily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a deſire to have a King of their own; And theſe things the Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of <hi>Mantoua</hi> was very ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of, and therefore continually ſolicited the King to know his Reaſon, or to deſire him to remove thoſe apparent opportunities which he had given the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> to effect a Revolt; But ſhe not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63178:108"/>
intricate and doubtful anſwers from the King and <hi>Olivarez;</hi> but had likewiſe the former Actions ſeconded with one, which made her think the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had a mind to toſs the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> into Duke <hi>Braganza</hi>'s hands whether he would or no; For on a ſudden without any notice given her, all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon in St. <hi>Johns</hi> Caſtle which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and indeed upon the ſtrength of which the whole ſafety and ſecurity of the Kingdom depended, were ſuddenly drawn forth and the Caſtle left to the diſpoſal of the Duke.</p>
            <p>But this was the laſt Act of Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Duke, for by truſting him ſo much, he now thought that he could not on the contrary but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe confidence in him, and therefore next Summer in 1640. he again by Letters ſollicites him to leave <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and come to <hi>Madrid,</hi> aſſuring him, <hi>That his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty gave him many thanks, and greatly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded his Loyalty in the exerciſe of the Office of General, and was very ſenſible of the good effects which his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had wrought on the</hi> Portugals; <hi>He next repreſented to him, the preſent declining condition of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, not only by reaſon of the diſorders in</hi> Flanders <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>and the preparations of the</hi> Turks, <hi>but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becauſe their moſt Potent Enemies the</hi> French, <hi>were now in Aſſiſtance of the revolted</hi> Catalonians <hi>entred</hi> Spain; <hi>That it highly concerned His Catholick Majeſty to drive them out of his Territories, which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very powerful Force. That he being one of the Prime Grandees of the Kingdom, might by his preſence in the head of a good number of his Tenants, encourage others to a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aſſiſtance; That to this purpoſe His Catholick Majeſty expected him every moment, having deſigned for him great Honours, Priviledges and Dignities ſuitable to his merit.</hi> But as cunning an Angler as <hi>Olivarez</hi> was, yet he fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Mark, this bait would not hook in the Fiſh; For though the Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was accounted no great Polititian, yet his own ſafety taught him to know, that all theſe great Offices, and fair Promiſes, were
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63178:108"/>
but guilded allurements to draw him to his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Having therefore ſupplyed the King with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of his Tenants and Friends, he found excuſes for his own not going in Perſon; And to prevent all ſuſpition, he retired again to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-houſe; Thus theſe 2 great Perſonages endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Craft and Diſſimulation to ſupplant each other; only one ſtrove the others deſtruction, the other only ſtudied his own ſafety and preſervation.</p>
            <p>During all theſe paſſages, the Vice-Queen <hi>Margari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> was very Vigilant in her Government, and foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reaſon what might be the iſſue of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, writ very importunately to the King, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that if it were not ſuddenly prevented, the Kingdom would be infallibly loſt; To which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved no anſwer, only <hi>Olivarez</hi> ſlighting her Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as fitter to govern a private Houſe than a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſent her word, <hi>That if her capacity would not reach to the height and drift of thoſe myſteries of State, yet that her wiſdom would keep her from diſcovering them;</hi> But without doubt <hi>Olivarez</hi> was inwardly perplexed, to ſee all his Plots thus fail, and foul means he durſt not openly attempt, ſuch was both the Dukes Power, and the great Love the people bore him, he therefore at laſt had recourſe to treachery, and gives ſecret or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Don <hi>Lopez de Oſſis,</hi> and Don <hi>Ant. Oquendo,</hi> that when they had relieved <hi>Flanders</hi> with Men and Money, they ſhould with their whole Fleet put into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that as ſoon as the Duke ſhould accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the duty of his new Place and Office come aboard, they ſhould immediately ſet ſail, and bring him away to <hi>Cales;</hi> But this Plot was by a ſtrange Divine Providence prevented, for that Fleet was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ruined by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in 1639.</p>
            <p>And now was the time come, wherein according to St. <hi>Bernards</hi> Propheſie, the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal</hi> was to be releaſed from the Tyranny of Strangers, and reſtored again to the Government of a Native
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63178:109"/>
King, to which all things ſeemed ſo well to concur, that it cannot be imagined to have leſs than a Divine hand in it; for though all Plots failing againſt the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being fearful of ſomewhat, drew as many <hi>Portugal</hi> Souldiers out of the Kingdom, as conveniently they could, thinking to leſſen the ill humours which began now to appear, yet thereby they did but the more inflame thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, which were taken at <hi>Vaſconſello's</hi> managing all Affairs of State; For though <hi>Margarita of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toua</hi> was a Princeſs of great Judgment and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in State Affairs, yet ſhe was too much over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi>'s Secretary of State, whoſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was inſufferable to the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> who hated as much his obſcure birth, as his evil cuſtoms, being a man Compoſed of Pride, Cruelty and Covetouſneſs, knowing no moderation but in exceſſes; Small faults were by him made Capital Crimes, uſing all ſeverity to thoſe whom he did but ſuſpect to be diſſatisfied with his Government, and exerciſing with all rigour the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſition, puniſhed not only the actions, but the very thoughts of men; The infringing the greateſt priviledges of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation ſeeming to him but a Trifle; which continued oppreſſions, in the end ſo exaſperated the whole people, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the knowledge of their own ſtrength, by the many diſtractions of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, by the late example of the <hi>Catalonians,</hi> and ſtirred up by the abſolute ruin which they ſaw hung over their heads, there being ſix Thouſand <hi>Portugals</hi> liſted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, and forced to ſerve the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Wars; From all theſe conſiderations, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to looſe the yoak from off their Necks, and to diſclaim all obedience to him, by the Election of a King of their own. Some thought that this conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was of at leaſt 10 years ſtanding, and agreed to by moſt of the Grandees of <hi>Portugal</hi> but it being a State Myſtery, is hard to be decided, I will therefore recount only what was publickly acted</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:63178:109"/>Upon Saturday <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. 1640. (and Saturdays have been often obſerved to be favourable to the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> Nation) all the Nobility of that Kingdom, led on by the Marqueſſes of <hi>Ferriera,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mioſo</hi> took Arms, and aſſiſted with a great multitude of the Inhabitants of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> and ſome <hi>Portuguez</hi> Souldiers, came to the Caſtle, ſcituate in the midſt of <hi>Liſbon,</hi> which was the Reſidence of the Vice-Queen, and ſerves both for a Palace and a Caſtle, to which place all the Magiſtrates for Governing the Kingdom were Aſſembled; The Guards were 2 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and 2 of <hi>High Dutch,</hi> who being either gained before by ſecret Intelligence, or affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the great numbers of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> or elſe from a deſire of Novelty, or perhaps unwilling to make reſiſtance againſt thoſe to whom moſt of them were joyned by Friendſhip or Marriage, but however they forſook their Guard without the leaſt oppoſition, and gave them free admittance into the Caſtle; At this time <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi> was in the Chambers of his Office, upon ſome reaſons he had to ſuſpect an Inſurrection, becauſe of the diſcontents of the People; and was at that inſtant writing into <hi>Spain</hi> of the Alienation of the minds of the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Nobility from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Government, and earneſtly preſſing that ſome ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous reſolution might be taken to prevent it; which Letters being afterward ſeized, did ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his ill will to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Nation; whilſt he was thus buſied, the confuſed noiſe of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pierced his ears, and wondring at the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he came forth accompanied only with one Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and one of the Guard, he would have gone down, but was hindred by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who came running up, crying, <hi>kill the Traytor, kill the enemy of our blood;</hi> Whereupon not knowing where to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he fled with thoſe accompanying him into an inner Chamber, and there with his ſword in his hand, aſſiſted by thoſe with him, diſpoſed himſelf to ſell his Life at the deareſt rate he could; but his valour
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63178:110"/>
ſtood him in no ſtead, for thoſe two who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend him, being ſlain with two Musket-ſhot; He ſeeing it in vain to defend himſelf there longer, leapt deſperately out of the Window, rather to ſeek his death, than out of any hopes to ſave his life; for no ſooner was he down, but numberleſs ſwords were imbrued in his blood, the very Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren running to tear in pieces his dead Body, with the ſame alacrity and chearfulneſs that he uſed to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them when alive.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferriera</hi> was gone to ſecure the Vice-Queen, whom having committed to the Guard of 200 Muſquetiers, he calls a Councel, and in a ſhort diſcourſe, ſets forth the miſeries the Kingdom had endured, whilſt ſubject to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government, who ſought nothing but their utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, then reminding them of the valour and merits of their Nation, he exhorts them to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the Election of a new King, nominating to them the Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi> as the moſt worthy of the Crown, not ſo much for his Power, Riches, or the greatneſs of his Houſe, as becauſe the Kingdom was his undoubted Right, he being the only perſon left of that Line, which <hi>for ſo many years had gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly governed</hi> Portugal; A long diſcourſe was ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to thoſe who were before perſwaded; A publick ſhout interrupted the Marqueſſes Speech, all of them crying with a loud voice; <hi>That they would have</hi> John <hi>Duke of</hi> Braganza <hi>for their King;</hi> In the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude there was not a face, much leſs a voice, that did gainſay this general Vote, either becauſe they did all really rejoyce, that they ſhould again have a King of their own Nation, or that none could without danger oppoſe themſelves againſt the Torrent of ſo publick a will.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Braganza</hi> was at this time at his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Houſe at <hi>Villa Vicioſa,</hi> either by Accident or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would always have had occaſion to excuſe himſelf, if the buſineſs had not ſucceeded; but by

            <p>Yet others affirm, that he was not only acquainted with the Deſign of the Revolt, but of Council about it; And that ſome time before, the Nobility having had a private Meeting at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> it was at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>That they ſhould reduce the Kingdom into the Form of a Common-wealth;</hi> But that not being approved of by the Major part, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> ſtood up, and in an eloquent Speech having laid before them the Miſeries they had endured under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke, recommended to them <hi>John</hi> D. of <hi>Braganza</hi> as the undoubted Heir of the Crown, and their Lawful Soveraign; This Motion they all moſt willingly aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and concluded to ſend <hi>Gaſton Cotigno</hi> a man of a fluent Tongue to acquaint the D. with their Intentions, and to perſwade him to accept the Crown and deliver his Countrey; <hi>Gaſton</hi> being arrived, with many well couched words acquaints him, <hi>That there was now a pregnant opportunity offered, to recover the indubitable Right of his Anceſtors to the Crown of</hi> Portugal, <hi>That the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Clergy were wholy inclined to redeem themſelves from the Tyranny of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>by ſecuring the Crown upon his head; That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> Odium, <hi>and hatred of the whole People to the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Government, the preſent low Condition of the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria, <hi>diſtracted on every ſide with War, The aſſured Aſſiſtance that</hi> France <hi>and other

Nations, emulating the greatneſs of</hi> Spain, <hi>would lend, were as ſo many motives to perſwade them, not to let ſlip ſo fair an opportunity to regain their Liberty. That if he by refuſal ſhould be the ſole Enemy to his Countreys Freedom, they would effect it themſelves and reduce it to a Commonwealth;</hi> Theſe and many other Arguments he uſed, which his Love to the Houſe of <hi>Braganza,</hi> his hatred to the <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> or his own ingenuity prompted him to.</p>
            <p>The Dukes amazement permitted him not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn a ſudden anſwer, but after a little Pauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; <hi>That he was highly obliged both to him, and all the Nobility for their Affections to him, but that this was a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs required great deliberation; that there was no</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um <hi>between a Throne, and a Chair of Execution; That therefore he ſhould firſt adviſe with himſelf, and not raſhly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſo hazardous a buſineſs;</hi> He therefore communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the whole Affair to his Dutcheſs <hi>Donna Lucia</hi> Siſter to the D. of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a Woman of a Noble, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick, and Maſculine Spirit; with her he conſults, whether he were beſt accept of the Propoſitions of the Nobility, or to prevent all hazards, go to <hi>Madrid;</hi> and being anxious what courſe to take, his Wife ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly told him, <hi>My Friend,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if thou goeſt to</hi> Madrid <hi>thou doſt incur the danger of loſing thy life, and if thou accepteſt the Crown thou doſt no more, conſider then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not better to dye nobly at home than baſely abroad;</hi> Theſe words of his Lady, ſay ſome, animated him with a Reſolution to accept the Crown; ſo he returned <hi>Gaſton</hi> an anſwer; <hi>That he would conform himſelf to the Counſels of the Nobility, reſolving to live and run all hazards whatever with them for the regaining his Countreys Liberty.</hi> In the mean time the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferreira</hi> reduced all thoſe Caſtles which held out for the K. of <hi>Spain,</hi> and then in the name of the K. of <hi>Portugal</hi> gave the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fidelity, or an Oath of Allegiance to all the Orders, that is to the Clergy, Nobility, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which was received with ſo much readineſs, that had not the Marqueſs ſeen the neceſſary Orders obſerved, the People had run into certain inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies,

ſo much they ſtrived to prevent each other in willingneſs to perform this duty.</p>
            <p>Upon Thurſday <hi>Feb.</hi> 6, His Majeſty made his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with all thoſe Applauſes that a Beloved King can expect from his moſt Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the Rich Liveries given by the Nobles, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal Arches, the Streets hung with Tapeſtry, the multitudes of People flocking to ſee him, and the Excellent Fire-works, which were ſo many, that a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> cried out, <hi>Es poſſible qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Certainly this is an evident Token that 'tis the Almighty hand of God;</hi> Yet theſe I ſay, were but the leaſt demonſtrations of that Cities Love and Joy; For ſo great was the Concourſe of thoſe that crouded to ſee their New King, that though His Majeſty entred into <hi>Lisbon</hi> by noon, he could not through the throng arrive at his Palace till two hours after Sun-ſet; Curioſity and Love, which uſually have the Force to ſtir up all Affections, made this People Flock ſo faſt to the ſight of their Prince, and even thoſe who hated the Houſe of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza,</hi> did accommodate themſelves to the General Joy; His Majeſty being arrived at the Pallace, in ſtead of repoſing himſelf, fell preſently to conſultation for preſerving the Kingdom he had thus ſuddenly gotten, and the ſeveral Governours were commanded to their Countreys to Levy Forces, who liſted the Inhabitants from the Age of eighteen to ſixty, in whom they found ſuch a ready willingneſs, that many offered their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and their Lives, and would follow the Colours, though they had Liberty to depart; On the 25 of the ſame Month, followed the Coronation of His Majeſty, which was accompanied with all thoſe Applauſes and Demonſtrations of Joy, that could proceed from a People of infinite Riches, who weary of the Command of Strangers were conſequently ambitious of a King of their own Nation; It was performed with all manner of Grandeur and Magnificence, the following Oath

being adminiſtred to the King by the Archbiſhops of <hi>Liſbon</hi> and <hi>Braga; We ſwear and promiſe by the Grace of God, to Rule and Govern you well and juſtly, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Juſtice as far as humane frailty will permit, to maintain unto you your Cuſtoms, Priviledges, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties granted unto you by the King's own Predeceſſors; So help us God, and this his Holy Goſpel.</hi> This Oath being adminiſtred, the 3 Eſtates of the Clergy, Nobility and Commons took the following Oath of Allegiance to His Majeſty, one for every one of the Eſtates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing theſe words: <hi>I ſwear by this Holy Goſpel of God, touching corporally with my hand, That I recieve for our King and Lawful Soveraign, the High and Mighty King</hi> Don John <hi>the Fourth our Soveraign, and do homage to him according to the uſe and cuſtoms of his Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, and the other Ceremonies being ended, the King accompanied with all his Nobles, returned from the Theatre, where the Coronation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to the Pallace, where notwithſtanding it was a very great rain, all the Grandees went bareheaded; There was a ſumptuous banquet prepared, but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty gave himſelf wholly to conſult of preparations for the War, and to ſhew the magnanimity of his mind, he only diſplaced two Officers; That of the <hi>Proveditore</hi> of the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> becauſe he was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law to the Secretary <hi>Vaſconſellos</hi> lately deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſlain, and that of the Count of <hi>Caſtanlie,</hi> who was Preſident of the <hi>Tribunal</hi> or <hi>Court of Conſcience,</hi> becauſe he was too much intereſted with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> As for the <hi>Infanta Margarita</hi> late Vice-Queen, and the Marqueſs <hi>Della Puella,</hi> Kinſman to <hi>Olivarez,</hi> the Caſtle called <hi>Paſos de Angiobregas</hi> was aſſigned them, with Fourteen Thouſand Crowns a year for maintenance in that honourable Priſon.

men together, from whence Cities and Kingdoms had their Original, and by which they after defended themſelves in War, and maintained themſelves in Peace; That for this cauſe His Majeſty had called this Aſſembly, to conſult for the better ſervice of God, defence in War, and Government in Peace; That there could be no ſervice of God without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in Religion, no defence without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion amongſt men, no regular Government without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Councils; That His Majeſty did expect to be informed by his Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects what was for the good of the State; That they were to render thanks to the Almighty, who had given them a King that would govern them by known Laws; That His Majeſty did not eſteem thoſe Tributes lawful which were paid with Tears; and therefore did from that preſent take off from his Subjects all Taxes that had been impoſed by the Kings of</hi> Spain, <hi>becauſe His Majeſty was not willing to Reign over their goods, nor over their heads, nor over their Priviledges, but over their hearts, hoping that they would find out a ſweet expedient to defend their Country againſt their Potent Enemy, who threatned to make them all ſlaves, and to deſtroy, and annihilate their Nation; That they would therefore conſidering his Majeſties goodneſs, and their own Honour, manifeſt at once to the world, that as never Subjects had ſuch a gracious King, ſo never King had ſuch Loyal Subjects.</hi>

            <p>The Biſhop having ended his Speech, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Officer of the Chamber of <hi>Liſbon</hi> ſtood up, and in the name of all the 3 Eſtates, who ſtood up like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, returned humble thanks to His Majeſty for this gracious bounty, heartily profeſſing, <hi>That they did not only offer up their Goods, but their Lives to His Majeſties ſervice, earneſtly intreating him to diſpoſe of both as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; And to manifeſt that their Hearts and Mouths agreed in this free offer of themſelves to His Majeſty, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voted, that two Millions ſhould be immediately raiſed by this Kingdom;</hi> But the King wiſely and politickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the impoſing a Tax on his Subjects, chooſing rather to accept of their <hi>Benevolence;</hi> which made every one ſtrive who ſhould offer moſt, ſo that inſtead

of the Two Millions, there was in ſhort time brought into the Treaſury Four Millions of Gold; Nor was this Money intended by them, nor imployed to any other uſe, then to maintain the <hi>Grandeza,</hi> and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the K. and Kingdom, there being no need of Money for the payment of Souldiers, every one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to ſerve freely, and at their own charge, againſt their vowed enemies the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

            <p n="104">104. The remarkable revolutions in the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> and the entire Conqueſt thereof by the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> happened in the ſame year 1640; As if ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal influence had inclined moſt Nations to changes and diſtractions at that time. It cannot therefore be unpleaſant to give a brief account thereof; The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>China</hi> enjoyed all the pleaſures of peace under the Government of their laſt Emperour, who was the moſt abſolute Monarch that ever ruled thoſe vaſt Territories; when in the year 1640, a year fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to ſeveral States, thoſe Clouds began to gather, which ſhortly after produced ſuch a ſtorm as ruined the whole Empire; The name of the preſent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was <hi>Zunchin,</hi> a deceitful, and unfortunate name, for in the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Language, it ſignifies <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> omen, or <hi>Soveraign Dominion,</hi> but how falſe a prognoſtick
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63178:114"/>
this was appeared quickly; This Emperor was of a moſt courteous and good diſpoſition, and certainly his Subjects, who enjoy'd great Plenty, and all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Peace, lived truly happy under ſo Excellent a Prince; But it is not ſufficient for a Prince to be Good, and to govern mildly and peaceably, unleſs he likewiſe takes care not to have ill Officers, who make uſe of their Credit under him, to gratifie their Private Paſſions and to extend their Ambition beyond all Bounds and Limits; yet ſome Authors have branded him for Covetouſneſs, and that after a great Famine which happened in the Northern Provinces, occaſioned by an unheard of number of Locuſts, he impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Subjects as high Taxes, as they paid formerly in fruitful flouriſhing times, the former Money being all miſpent, and the Souldiers not paid; Whereupon the number of the Mutineers daily increaſed, who enriched themſelves by Plunder and Rapine. For as <hi>Semedo</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>China</hi> intimates, <hi>Rebellion is the uſual Effect of Extortion and Tyranny, especially where the Prince would have more from the People than they are able to give, And therefore</hi> Theopompus (ſaith he) <hi>King of the</hi> Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians, <hi>when his wife told him, that becauſe he had eaſed the People of many Taxes, he would leave his Son a poorer Kingdom, than he received from his Father; anſwered, Relinquo ſed Diuturnius;</hi> that is, <hi>I ſhall leave him a more laſting Kingdom,</hi> Happy had it been for <hi>Zunchin</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>China</hi> had he been of <hi>Theopompus</hi> his Mind.</p>
            <p>But (ſaith my Author) though I find him charged with Covetouſneſs, yet I am not very apt to ſuſpect him ſo guilty of that Vice, as of another uſually more fatal to Princes, which is a facile Nature, eaſie to be wrought upon by others, and too inclinable to favour and indulge themſelves, and not willing to undergo the weight of Affairs; From whence it was, that though under the Reign of his Brother <hi>Thienking,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded him in the Imperial Throne, <hi>Zunchin</hi> ſo oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Darling Favourite the Eunuch <hi>Guei,</hi> and all the Eunuchs his Partiſans, that at laſt he prevailed
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63178:115"/>
with his brother to baniſh them all his Court, to the great Satisfaction of the whole Empire, and when his Brother dying without Iſſue the Imperial Crown fell to him, at his firſt taking poſſeſſion thereof, he ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Eunuchs who by abuſe of their Authority under his Brother had made themſelves abhorred by the whole Nation, that <hi>Guei</hi> in deſpair poyſoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; yet at laſt this very Emperor ſuffered himſelf, by the crafty inſinuation of ſome about him, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his own Judgment, to be prevailed with to recal thoſe inſolent Extortioners, and moſt imprudently made his incenſed Enemies, his reconciled Confidents. And intruſts them with the ſole Management of all Affairs, who now conceal their Malice againſt him, but forgot not to Study revenge; and being backed with his Authority, by their Extortion they grind the face of the People, enrich themſelves, render their Maſter odious to his Subjects, endeavour by all Arts to defraud him, keep back his Souldiers pay and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, thereby to occaſion Mutinies; hold correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Rebels, not acquaint him with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that Threatned both him and his Empire, and at laſt admit the whole Army of the Traytors into the very Walls of the City <hi>Peking,</hi> the ſad Conſequences whereof we ſhall find hereafter.</p>
            <p>It was in the year 1640 when two Rebels at the ſame time revolted againſt their Lawful Soveraign, one of them was called <hi>Ly,</hi> or <hi>Licungz,</hi> the other <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Changien,</hi> and though they were but private Subjects of the Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> and Perſons of no Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either by their Quality or Birth, yet they both equally aſpired to the Supream Dominion; And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn to them great numbers of the choiceſt Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the Empire, they began to make incurſions upon the Northern Provinces which border upon <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi> The Emperour in the mean time did not take ſufficient care to ſtifle this Revolt; In all likelyhood the Complaints and Informations of thoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who guarded the Frontiers never entred the Court
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63178:115"/>
ſo far as to reach the Emperors Ears; The Miniſters of State, and Officers of the Court ſtopped the Paſſage, having already ſold the Empire and their Maſter, by abuſing his mild Diſpoſition; The ſaying of <hi>Diocleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is but too True, <hi>That though a Prince be Good, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Obſervant, Careful, and Vigilant, yet he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Treachery, if thoſe who are in imployment under Him, &amp; who ought to ſerve and adviſe him Faithfully, do contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe combine together to ſurprize him, and make ill uſe of his Authority; Either the Ability and Fidelity of the Counſellors muſt ſtrike a Terror into Rebels, or they will ſoon make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Terror both to the Prince, and His Counſellors.</hi> The two Cheifs of this Rebellion took ſuch advantage by this Pernicious Negligence, that thoſe Counſels which if at firſt executed would with great facility have put an end to theſe Troubles, became now both unfit, and impoſſible to be put in Execution; In a ſhort time they gained themſelves the Renown of Great and moſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Commanders, and by this advantage they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had Forces enough, not only to defend themſelves, but to inlarge their Conqueſts, their Confederates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing daily ſo that by force of Arms they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of Five Provinces.</p>
            <p>The Rebel <hi>Cham</hi> went to eſtabliſh himſelf in that Province which of the five was the moſt remote from the Emperors Court, and took upon him the Title of King, with full Reſolution to extend his Conqueſts to the Neighbouring Provinces; The other Rebel called <hi>Ly,</hi> having, as it appeared, framed to himſelf greater deſigns, approached nearer the Court, and had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in his Imagination conquered the whole Empire; But judging from the advantage he had received from <hi>Cham's</hi> Confederacy with him at the beginning, how great an obſtacle ſo powerful a Competitor might be to him in proceſs of time, he did in all likelihood make him away, either by ſecret Treachery or open Violence, ſome Hiſtorians affirming he was cut off by a Party ſent againſt him by <hi>Ly,</hi> or <hi>Lincungz,</hi> who having now no Competitor that could aſpire to the Soverainty, began

to noiſe abroad his vaſt Projects, and ſettled himſelf in the Capital City of the Province <hi>Xenſi,</hi> called <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſuaſe;</hi> He cauſed himſelf to be crowned, and took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the Title of Emp. of <hi>China,</hi> kept an Imperial Court, and acted like a Soveraign Prince, threatning in a ſhort time to make himſelf Maſter of the Emperors Court, and to join <hi>Pequin</hi> which is the Chief, to the five other Provinces; It is not certainly known what was the firſt riſe of theſe 2 Uſurpers, only it is famed that they were both Generals in the Emperour of <hi>China</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who perceiving themſelves, nor Souldiers to be neither regarded, nor recompenced for their Services, but to be ill uſed by the Miniſters of State, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted againſt their King, and conſpired together to be their own Pay-maſters; reſolving to make the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of the Court underſtand, <hi>That thoſe who ſerve their Prince in his Armies are without Compariſon better capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſerve or diſſerve the State, than thoſe whoſe ſole Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is by their Court Artifices to ingratiate themſelves with their Prince:</hi> They began at firſt with Complaints, and from Complaints they came to Arms, and having once began the Trechery, they thought themſelves engaged moſt vigorouſly to proſecute it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Flame of Rebellion, and Civil War, which every day increaſed, threatned the whole Empire of <hi>China</hi> with a General Ruin and Revolution the <hi>Tartar</hi> did moſt attentively and vigilantly watch for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to enter into ſome or all the Provinces, yet he would imbrace none but what was honourable, having ſolemnly ſworn Peace with the Royal Family of <hi>China;</hi> and therefore he could not reſolve with himſelf, as great an Idolater as he was, to violate that Oath which he had taken in the preſence of his Idols; A great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to thoſe, who boaſt of the True Religion, and yet ſwear and promiſe without regarding the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance either of their Oaths or Promiſes; Finally the <hi>Tartar</hi> judged very truly, that if he joined his Forces with any one of the 2 Parties, he ſhould in a ſhort time make himſelf Umpire and Maſter of one or both; he
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63178:116"/>
therefore joined with neither, but kept an Army under ſtrict diſcipline on the Frontiers, hoping for ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity of paſſing into <hi>China</hi> without falſifying his Faith, which he deſired to keep inviolable; <hi>Ly</hi> in the mean time reſolved to ſecure the whole Empire to himſelf, though it could not be done without difficulty ſince the <hi>Chineſes</hi> have ſuch a tender and paſſionate Love to their Soveraigns, that they ſeem rather to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolize than love them, and the preſent Prince was no leſs Beloved than any of his Anceſtors, which the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being ſenſible of, for his own ſecurity took care to pay his Souldiers, and reſolved with all poſſible ſpeed to compleat the entire Invaſion of the whole Empire; But firſt he thought fit to acquaint his moſt reſolute Commanders and his greateſt Confidents, with his Reſolutions, which he did in theſe Terms;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Lot is caſt, we muſt now either gain all or loſe all, we cannot hereafter be greater Rebels than we are already, therefore let us dispatch with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition the Conqueſt of the other Ten Provinces of</hi> China, <hi>now that we have made</hi> 5 <hi>Provinces feel the power of our Swords. But moſt aſſuredly when we ſhall have ſubdued the reſt, none will be ſo audacious and raſh to call us Rebels and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers; Rebels if Victorious ceaſe to be Rebels, and become the Right and Lawful Lords and Maſters; What therefore now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that I either make my ſelf the Soveraign Monarch of</hi> China, <hi>or loſe my Life in theſe Feilds, and there become a Prey to Birds of the Air, and Beaſts of the Feild; there is nothing in all this spacious Empire can gratifie me, but either a Throne or a Grave, and I will advance my ſelf to ſuch a pitch of Grandeur, that if I fall, it ſhall be with ſuch a Crack as ſhall ſhiver the whole frame of Government, and bury the whole Empire under my Ruins.</hi> Thus <hi>Ly</hi> ſpoke to his Followers, that were intirely devoted to him, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Reſolution, he ſpeedily entred upon a moſt bold and hazardous Deſign, but of high importance for the ſudden accompliſhing his Pretenſions, which was to go directly againſt the very Perſon of the Emp. and with all his Forces to aſſault the Imperial Court, and
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63178:117"/>
Capital City of the Empire, fully determining to ſtrike off the Emperors head, and to place the Crown on his own; By this eminent exploit he knew he ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of the Kings Treaſure, which would highly ſtrengthen his Party, and beſides cut off all Power from any of the Royal Family to raiſe any Forces, or to head any who ſhould yet have any ſparks of Loyalty in their Breaſt. To execute this Grand Attempt, he muſt make himſelf Maſter of the Great City of <hi>Pequin,</hi> where all the Court reſided; But he could not hope to do this by open Force, and therefore reſolves to do it by Stratagem, and ſo to ſurprize the Town, that the Thunderclap ſhould be felt before the noiſe was heard. By this ſudden ſurprize, he would not leave the Emp. time to prepare either for his defence or flight; Otherwiſe it would have been very difficult for <hi>Ly</hi> with all his Force he could have raiſed, to have ſo ſuddenly reduced this Great <hi>City;</hi> For beſide the vaſt Extent of <hi>Pequin,</hi> it was very well fortified, and in time of Peace was guarded with 80000 of the Emp. beſt Souldiers; The Imperial Palace alone is above 2 Miles round, and defended with 2 or 3 Walls, Ditches and Bulwarks, which are all diſtinct from each other and very ſtrongly guarded. <hi>Ly</hi> foreſaw all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and therefore he had already by Preſents and fair Promiſes bribed ſeveral of the Grandees of the Court and Council, whereby he found it not difficult to engage them in his Intereſts. A ſtrange thing, that when there was not one Perſon of the common people either in City or Court who could be drawn into this Treaſon, yet ſeveral of the Magiſtrates and Officers of the Court made themſelves a deteſtable Example, by entring into a conſpiracy againſt the State, and the Perſon of their Prince; The chief of the conſpirators were the Eunuchs of the Imperial Palace, who were then very potent, and conſiderable in the Court, and upon whoſe Fidelity the Emperor of <hi>China</hi> much preſumed, entruſting them with the Guard of his Perſon and the Government of the State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:63178:117"/>The Tyrant <hi>Ly</hi> having thus laid his treaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he ſent into the imperial City of <hi>Pequin</hi> ſeveral of his Truſty, and moſt valiant Commanders, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like Merchants, with inſtructions to keep open ſhop, and to ſell ſeveral Rich Merchandizes; Theſe counterfeit Merchants were never ſuſpected to be great Commanders, and their Apprentices and Servants choice Souldiers; But it concerned them to mind their Trade, for upon that depended the purchaſe of the greateſt Empire in the world, which was put to ſale by thoſe who were moſt of all obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and defend it; When the bargain was thus made and earneſt mutually given, thoſe in the City and Court, who kept Intelligence with the Tyrant, failed not upon ſeveral pretences to leſſen the Guards, and to weaken as much as poſſible the ſtrength of the place; And on a ſudden <hi>Ly</hi> appeared, and found the Gates of the Town open, and his men victorious in the Conqueſt of this great City; the Inhabitants being ſo aſtoniſhed, that before they could reſiſt, they found themſelves under the power of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; The Emperor <hi>Zunchin</hi> did not perceive the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition of his State till it was paſt remedy, for now he knew that the rage of his enemies would not only take from him by violence his Empire and Crown, but his life alſo; and then too late percieved the deſign of thoſe ill Counſellors, who adviſed him not to raiſe Forces, nor ſend Money nor Recruits to thoſe Commanders, who guarded the Frontiers; He now poor Prince, ſaw himſelf beſieged in his own Pallace, and was fully convinced he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore thought of nothing but to depart out of this life by a death worthy of his Dignity and Courage; His deſperate condition made him feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect, how much in him was to be pityed, the too facile and eaſie natures and diſpoſition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which is uſually attended with ſad diſaſters both to themſelves, and their States.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Pequin</hi> being of a vaſt extent, before
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63178:118"/>
the Traytors could by Force enter the Pallace, which was very ſpacious, ſome of the moſt Loyal Officers, and Souldiers made a vigorous reſiſtance, which the Emperour lookt upon as a grateful Teſtimony of their Allegiance, ſince thereby he had liberty to chooſe his own death, which he conſidered as his laſt happineſs; A frail and cruel ſatisfaction which the pride of man makes him ſeek out, to be his own Executioner, that thereby he may dye with the greater renown and pomp. During the time of this reſiſtance, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour conſidered how ſpeedily to diſpoſe both of his Royal Family and Perſon, which was in the moſt Tragical manner that ever Hiſtories related; He had but one only Daughter, very young, which till now had been the hope and deſire of the Empire, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Son dying before this direful diſaſter; The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour cut her Throat with his own hands, and at her own ſupplication, that ſhe might not ſee her Honour and Illuſtrious Rank become a ſhameful Prey to a Tyrant and Traytor, who had nothing great and eminent in him, but his Treaſon and Rebellion againſt his Lawful Soveraign; After this horrid Execution, the Emperour with his hands, yet reeking with the blood of his Daughter, went into the Garden of the Pallace, accompanied with his Lawful Spouſe, the Empreſs, for whom he had forſaken ſix other Wives who had each of them the Title of Queen, 30 others who were the moſt illuſttrious Ladies of the Empire, and 3000 others of leſſer Quality; Some of their faithful ſervants underſtanding their cruel intentions, filled the Air in proclaiming their griefs, ſome cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>My Lord and my Huſband,</hi> others, <hi>My King and my Master,</hi> and ſome <hi>my Father,</hi> every one accent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſorrow in a tone ſuitable to their part in this ſcene of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>The heart of this unfortunate Prince was penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo great affliction, that it could admit of no Conſolation, and only comforted himſelf that he ſhould preſerve the Honour of his Empreſs, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63178:118"/>
unconcerned for his other Queens, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Wives; Some few Courtiers, who among ſo many Traytors remained faithful to him, attended with a doleful ſilence upon the Emperour and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who could neither ſpeak a word, nor ſhed a tear, ſorrow had taken ſuch entire poſſeſſion of their hearts. <hi>Zunchin</hi> was a young Prince, endowed with all the qualities that might render him amiable to his People; His Royal Spouſe the Empreſs loved him with ſo tender an affection, that to teſtifie the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her Paſſion to him, ſhe reſolved to dye either with or before him; The Prince being very penſive, and ſollicitous how to prevent greater diſgraces, went together with thoſe who accompanied him towards a little Grove, at the entrance of which he ſtopped, and then the Empreſs gueſſing at his deſign, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, and giving him her laſt embraces, ſhe part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that perſon which was the deareſt to her of all things upon Earth, with all the grief and ſorrow that Humane Nature is capable of, and then ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred all alone into the Grove, and with a Cord hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf upon one of the Trees; A dreadful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle which might make even thoſe who were more ſenſleſs than the Trees, lament ſo direful a death of ſo great an Empreſs. Preſently after, the Emperour went and placed himſelf near his Wife, whom he ſaw hanging upon a Tree, having finiſhed her Life by a death as violent as that which he had inflicted upon his Daughter; Then poor Prince he asked a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wine of one of the Lords which attended him, not that he was a lover of Wine, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was the moſt ſober, and moderate in his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all the Princes which ever governed the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; And was ſo chaſt toward women that he never frequented his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> which made his Subjects call him the <hi>Chaſt Prince;</hi> It was not therefore for the love of Wine, but a little to revive and refreſh his Spirits; And doubtleſs he had need of great courage to put in Execution what he deſigned; When the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63178:119"/>
Wine was preſented to him he ſipped a little of it, and then biting with violence one of his Fingers, and ſqueezing out his blood, he writ therewith theſe following words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Mandorins <hi>(or Eunuchs) are all Villains; they have perfidiouſly betrayed their Prince, they all deſerve to be hanged, and it will be a laudable Act of Juſtice, to execute this Sentence upon them; It is fit they ſhould all ſuffer death, that thereby they might inſtruct thoſe who ſucceed them to ſerve their Prince more Loyally; As for the People they are not Criminal, and deſerve not to be puniſhed, and therefore to uſe them ill, will be injuſtice; I have loſt my Kingdoms which I recieved in inheritance from my Anceſtors; In me is finiſhed the Royal Line, which ſo many Kings my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors continued down to me, with all the Grandeur, and Fame ſuitable to their Majeſtick Dignity, I will therefore for ever cloſe my eyes, that I may not ſee this Empire deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to me, thus ruined and ruled by a Tyrant; I will go and deprive my ſelf of that Life for which I can never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf to be indebted to the baſeſt and vileſt of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; I have not the confidence to appear before them, who being born Subjects are become my Enemies and Traytors; It is fit the Prince ſhould dye, ſince his whole State is now expiring; And how can I endure to live, having ſeen the loſs and deſtruction of that which was dearer to me than Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince, after he had thus writ what his juſt grief dictated to him, he untied his Hair, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering his face, preſently with his own hands he hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf upon a Tree, near to that on which the Empreſs remained ſtrangled; This was the Tragical <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of this unfortunate Monarch. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>China</hi> remained thus hanging on a Tree, the Prince who was the Idol of his people, at the very name of whom Millions of men trembled; The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of above an 100 Millions of Subjects, the Monarch of a Kingdom as ſpacious as all <hi>Europe;</hi> He who counted his Souldiers by Millions, and his Taxes and Tributes by hundreds of Millions; Finally, the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63178:119"/>
Potent Emperour of the great Empire of <hi>China</hi> is hanged upon a tree, and his Royal Conſort the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon another near him; What a weighty load did the trunks of theſe trees ſupport? But of what weight had it need be, to make the great men upon earth duly weigh what all their terrible and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Grandeur</hi> is, which in ſo few moments paſſes from the height of the felicities of this Life to an Abyſs of miſery; This unhappy Monarch finiſhed his Reign at the Age of 32 years; He dyed very ſoon, but it was his misfortune he dyed no ſooner; For whatever King or Emperour he be who reckons his years which have been expoſed to ſuch direful Tragedies, cannot be ſaid to have lived ſuch a number of years, but to have undergone a far greater number of miſeries and calamities.</p>
            <p>The Report of the Emperours death being ſoon ſpread over the City, thoſe Loyal Subjects, who had hitherto reſiſted, abandoned their reſolution; So that <hi>Ly</hi> preſently became Maſter both of the City and Court, taking up his quarters in the Imperial Pallace, where he ſaw himſelf poſſeſſed of all the prodigious treaſures of that vaſt State, and was ſoon after Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Court at <hi>Pequin,</hi> and Proclaimed Soveraign Emperour of <hi>China,</hi> yet he enjoyed his trayterous uſurpation a very ſhort time, for the <hi>Tartars</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Obligations of the former League of peace, made void by the death of <hi>Zunchin,</hi> and all the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, Soon after invaded the Empire of <hi>China,</hi> and made an abſolute conqueſt thereof, forcing the Tyrant <hi>Ly</hi> to fly, and hide himſelf in the Northern parts of the Kingdom, who has not ſince been heard of; Neither did the treacherous Eunuchs eſcape ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, for they were in a little while moſt of them deſtroyed and cut off by the <hi>Tartars.
